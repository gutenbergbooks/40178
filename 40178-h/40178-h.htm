<h1>The Carter Girls&rsquo; Mysterious<br />
Neighbors</h1>


<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

<span class="f8">EN ROUTE TO THE FARM</span></h2>


<p>&ldquo;How I hate being poor!&rdquo; exclaimed Helen
Carter, looking ruefully at her darned glove.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me, too!&rdquo; echoed the younger sister, Lucy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shh! Father will hear you,&rdquo; admonished
Douglas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody can hear above the rattle of this
horrid old day coach,&rdquo; declared Helen. &ldquo;There
is something about the odor of a common coach
that has spent its life hauling commuters from
home to work&mdash;from work to home, that sickens
me,&rdquo; and Helen&rsquo;s sensitive nostrils quivered in
disgust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, dear; I know it is all so hard on
you,&rdquo; said Douglas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit harder on me than it is on you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit!&rdquo; from Lucy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it must be,&rdquo; smiled Douglas. &ldquo;I
have an idea Nature did not intend me to ride in
Pullmans. I am really just as comfortable in a
day coach and I think they are lots more airy
and better ventilated. What do you think about
it, Nan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I like &rsquo;em&mdash;such interesting types,&rdquo;
drawled Nan. &ldquo;You get to your destination
sooner, too, as the Pullman is always hitched onto
the back end of the train.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see anything very interesting in commuters,
I must say,&rdquo; laughed Helen, &ldquo;but Nan
was always easy to please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Nan is our philosopher,&rdquo; said Douglas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, since Lucy and I are to join the army
of commuters it would be foolish of us not to find
them interesting. Don&rsquo;t you remember Mrs. Doasyouwouldbedoneby?
If we find them interesting
maybe they will return the compliment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I remember Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid,
too,&rdquo; declared Douglas, exchanging a sly
glance with Helen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>The two older sisters could not help seeing
that a nice looking boy sitting across the aisle
had already found something to interest him in
the dreamy brown eyes of one courageous commuter
to be. His own grey eyes were twinkling
with merriment. Evidently the rattle of the
despised coach had not drowned the conversation
so far as he was concerned. He had made some
pretense of studying, but Latin Comp. was
deadly dull in comparison with the chatter of the
Carter girls.</p>

<p>The Carters were <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> to their winter
quarters, chosen after much discussion and misgivings
as the best place they could find for all
concerned. The doctor had pronounced the ultimatum:
Mr. Carter must be in the country for
another year at least and he must have no business
worries. He must live out-of-doors as much
as possible and no matter how perplexing the
problems that in the natural course of events
would arise in a household, they were not to be
brought to the master of that household. As
Mrs. Carter had determined many weeks before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
to play the rôle of a lily of the field, announcing
herself as a semi-invalid, who was to be loved and
cherished and waited on but not to be worried,
it meant that Douglas, as oldest child, must be
mother and father as well. Hers was the thankless
task of telling her sisters what they must and
must not do, and curbing the extravagance that
would break out now and then in spots. Small
wonder that it was the case, as, up to a few
months before this, lavish expenditure had been
the rule in the Carter family rather than the exception.</p>

<p>They had spent a wonderful summer running
a week-end boarding camp on the side of a mountain
in Albemarle County. It had been a remarkable
thing for these young girls to have
undertaken and accomplished, all untrained as
they were. But when their father&rsquo;s nervous
breakdown came and the realization that there
was no more money in the family till, and none
likely to be there unless they could earn it, right
manfully they put their young shoulders to the
wheel and with a long push and a strong push<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and a push all together they got their wagon, if
not hitched to a star, at least moving along the
highroad of life and making some progress.</p>

<p>Dr. George Wright, the nerve specialist who
had undertaken Mr. Carter&rsquo;s cure, had been invaluable
in their search for the proper place in
which to spend the winter, this winter that was
to put the keystone in their father&rsquo;s recovery.
Such a place was not easy to find, as it must be
near enough to Richmond for Nan and Lucy to
go to school. That was one time when Douglas
put her foot down most emphatically. The two
younger girls were quite willing to follow in
their sister Helen&rsquo;s footsteps and &ldquo;quiturate,&rdquo;
but Douglas knew that they must be held to their
tasks. She bitterly regretted her own inability
to continue her education, as college had been her
dream, and she also deplored the fact that Helen
was not able to spend the one more year at school
necessary for her graduation. As for Helen, not
having to go to school was the one bright spot
for her in the whole sordid business, at least she
had boldly declared such was the case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>The winter was to be a busy one for Helen, as
the home work was to fall to her share. Douglas,
by a great piece of good luck, had obtained a
place as teacher in a district school not far from
the little farm that had been selected as the abiding
place for the Carter family during that winter
of 1916 and &rsquo;17. The teacher who had been
employed had been called away by private affairs,
and Douglas had fallen heir to the position.</p>

<p>The train rocked and swayed and bumped on
the illy-laid road-bed as our girls sped on to their
destination. Mrs. Carter in a seat across the aisle
had placed her tired head on her husband&rsquo;s shoulder.
The poor little lady felt in her heart of
hearts that all of this going to out-of-the-way
country places to spend winter months was really
absurd, but then it was absurd to be poor anyhow,
something she had not bargained for in her
scheme of existence. She had said not a word,
however, but had let Douglas and that stern Dr.
Wright manage everything. She felt about as
capable of changing the plans of her family as
her youngest child, Bobby, might.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Bobby, who had spent the time on the train
most advantageously, having made friends with
the brakeman and conductor, was now sitting in
an alert attitude, as his new friends had informed
him that there were only five minutes more before
they would reach Grantly, their destination. Going
to the country was just what he wanted and
he was preparing to have a glorious time with no
restrictions as to clean face and hands. To be
sure, he had heard that he was to go to school,
but since Douglas was to be the teacher this fact
was not disturbing him much.</p>

<p>The summer in the mountains had done much
to develop this darling of the Carters. He no
longer looked so much like an angel as when we
were first introduced to the family. His curls
were close cropped now and he was losing teeth
faster than he was gaining them. If there could
be such a thing as a snaggled tooth angel perhaps
that celestial being would resemble Bobby Carter;
but I am sure if that angel could have
thought up as much mischief in a week as Bobby
could execute in an hour, he would have met the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
fate of Lucifer and been hurled from Heaven.
It may be, though, that if Lucifer had possessed
such eyes as this little boy he would have been
forgiven and might still be in his happy home.
It was an impossibility to harbor wrath against
Bobby if once you looked in his eyes. They were
like brown forest pools. His sister Nan had the
same eyes and the same long curling lashes. The
shape and color of their eyes were inherited from
their beautiful little mother, but the soulful expression
that the children possessed was something
that came from within and is not controlled
by laws of heredity. Mrs. Carter&rsquo;s eyes if they
reminded one of forest pools were certainly very
shallow pools.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At last!&rdquo; as the brakeman called out their
station, came with a sigh of relief from the whole
family.</p>

<p>The station consisted of a platform and a little
three-sided shed designed to shield the traveler
from the weather, if the weather did not happen
to arrive on the unprotected fourth side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They promised to meet us,&rdquo; said Douglas as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
she collected parcels and umbrellas, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t
see a sign of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe they are on the other side,&rdquo; suggested
the hopeful Nan, peering through the window.</p>

<p>They weren&rsquo;t, however, nor anywhere in sight.
Douglas and Helen looked at each other askance.
The two older girls were the only ones in the
family who had seen their future abode and they
felt very responsible. This hitch of not being
met was most disconcerting. They had felt if
everything went off smoothly and well their
choice of a home would be smiled upon. First,
the day they moved must be good, and this day
in October was surely perfect. The packing
must be done without bustle and confusion, and
that had been accomplished. They must have a
good luncheon before leaving Richmond, and
Miss Elizabeth Somerville, who had invited them
to her house, had feasted her cousins most royally,
sending them forth with well-nourished
bodies and peaceful minds in consequence. This
was the first obstacle to their carefully laid plans.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
They were to learn that no plan depending in
any particular on the coöperation of their landladies,
the Misses Grant, would go through
safely.</p>

<p>Miss Ella and Miss Louise Grant were joint
owners of the small farm that the glib real estate
agent had persuaded Dr. Wright and our girls
was the one and only place in which the winter
could be comfortably spent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excellent air and water; close to schools and
churches; neighborhood as good as to be found
in Virginia, and what more could be said?
House one of the old landmarks of the county;
the view from the front porch quite a famous
one; R.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;D. at yard gate; commuting distance
from Richmond; roads excellent, as we
have found on our way here.&rdquo; They had motored
out and certainly the roads had seemed very
good.</p>

<p>The Misses Grant were all that was left of a
large and at one time influential family. They
lived in a great old mansion erected in the middle
of what was at one time a vast estate but which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
had gradually shrunk through generations of
mortgages until now it comprised about two
thousand acres. The name of this old place was
Grantly.</p>

<p>The farm that Helen and Douglas had rented
for the year was only called a farm by courtesy,
as it had in its holding only about ten acres. It
had at one time been the home of the overseer of
Grantly when that aristocratic estate could boast
an overseer. It was too humble an abode to have
a name of its own, but our girls were determined
to give it a name when they found out what would
suit it. Now they stood on the platform of the
tiny station and said in their hearts that such a
place, belonging to such unreliable persons, deserved
no name at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so sorry they haven&rsquo;t sent to meet
us. They told me if I would write to them they
would have a carriage and a farm wagon here,&rdquo;
wailed Douglas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not walk?&rdquo; suggested Mr. Carter.
&ldquo;A quarter of a mile is nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, do let&rsquo;s walk!&rdquo; exclaimed Lucy. &ldquo;We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
can just leave the luggage here and get someone
to come back for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All of you can walk,&rdquo; came faintly from Mrs.
Carter. &ldquo;Just leave me here alone. I don&rsquo;t
fancy anything much will happen to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Mumsy, only a quarter of a mile!&rdquo;
begged Lucy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, my child, I never expect to walk more
than a few blocks again as long as I live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Carter looked pained and ended by staying
with his wife while the four girls and Bobby
trooped off to find someone to send for them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why does Mother say she never expects to
walk more than a few blocks again as long as she
lives?&rdquo; blurted out Lucy. &ldquo;Is she sick? She
looks to me like she&rsquo;s getting fat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell her that,&rdquo; suggested Nan, &ldquo;and I bet
you she will find she can walk a teensy little more
than a few blocks.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

<span class="f8">THE LANDLADIES AND A NEW ACQUAINTANCE</span></h2>


<p>&ldquo;This is a long quarter of a mile,&rdquo; said Nan,
trying to keep up with her more athletic sisters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The agent told us a quarter of a mile, but I
reckon he meant as the crow flies. He did not
allow for all the twistings and turnings of this
lane,&rdquo; laughed Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a very pretty walk, anyhow, and I&rsquo;m
glad we are not so close to the track because of
Bobby,&rdquo; said the philosophic Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shucks! You needn&rsquo;t be a-thinkin&rsquo; I can&rsquo;t
find my way back to that old station,&rdquo; said that
young hopeful. &ldquo;I wisht it was barefoot time
and I would wade in that branch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were crossing a pretty little stream that
intersected the road. Of course Bobby took occasion
to slip off the stepping-stones and get his
foot wet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;long as one is wet I reckon I might as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
get th&rsquo; other one wet, too,&rdquo; and he stepped boldly
into the stream. &ldquo;Sqush! Sqush! Ain&rsquo;t this a
grand and glorious feeling?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bobby!&rdquo; chorused his sisters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t gonter make no diffunce! My
&rsquo;ployer says sech things as this toughen kids.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bobby always called Dr. Wright his employer,
as it had been his habit to go with that
young physician while he was making his professional
calls, his duties being to hold out his
arm when they were turning corners or preparing
to stop; and to sit in the car and guard his
&rsquo;ployer&rsquo;s property from the depredations of
hoodlums and micks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think some kids need toughening,&rdquo;
said Nan, trying to look severe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;n I gotter joke on you, too! They was
a pretty near grown-up boy on the train wanted
to know what yo&rsquo; name was. I was jawin&rsquo; the
inductor an&rsquo; the boy comed and plunked hissef
down by me an&rsquo; he axed me what was my name
and where I was a-gointer, an&rsquo; was all&rsquo;n you my
aunts or what. He was so busy a-findin&rsquo; out he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
come near a-missing his gettin&rsquo; off place. He
lives jus&rsquo; befo&rsquo; our gettin&rsquo; off place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that must have been the good-looking
boy sitting opposite us, just behind Mother and
Father! You noticed him, Douglas, didn&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; asked Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he wasn&rsquo;t a-noticin&rsquo; you much,&rdquo; proceeded
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">enfant terrible</i>. &ldquo;He wanted mostly
to know what was Nan&rsquo;s name an&rsquo; where she
went to school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely you didn&rsquo;t tell him!&rdquo; blushed Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sho&rsquo; nix! I told him yo&rsquo; name was Lizajane
an&rsquo; you was a-clerkin&rsquo; in the five an&rsquo; ten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bobby!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nobody could help laughing at the saucy
youngster, and his sisters were ever inclined to
find him amusing and altogether delightful in
spite of his outrageousness. Their laughter
rang out clear and infectious. First they
laughed at Bobby and then they laughed for the
pure joy of laughing. Douglas forgot her burdens
and responsibilities; Helen forgot how she
hated to be poor; Nan forgot that the quarter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
a mile she was going to have to trudge twice a
day to join the army of commuters was much
nearer half a mile and she was not a very energetic
girl; Lucy had nothing to forget or regret,
being only thirteen with a perfect digestion.
For the moment all of them forgot the nerve-worn
father and the hypochondriacal mother
waiting so forlornly at the station with the luggage
piled so hopelessly at one end.</p>

<p>In the midst of their gale of laughter they
heard the hum of a motor and the toot of a horn.
A large touring car came swerving around the
curve in the road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s him now!&rdquo; cried the delighted Bobby.</p>

<p>It was no other than the boy on the train. He
stopped his car and with crimson face began to
stammer forth unintelligible words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me!&mdash;but&mdash;that is a&mdash;you see I&mdash;&mdash;
Oh, hang it all! er&mdash;my name is William&mdash;Will&mdash;Billy
Sutton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s plum nutty an&rsquo; thinks he&rsquo;s Billy
Sunday&mdash;Billy Nut Sunday!&rdquo; and Bobby
danced gleefully in his squshy shoes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Bobby! Behave yourself!&rdquo; said Douglas,
trying to swallow the laugh she was in the midst
of.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We was jes&rsquo; a-talkin&rsquo; about you,&rdquo; said
Bobby, with his most disarming smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About me?&rdquo; and the young fellow choked
his engine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I was a-tellin&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But here Helen took her little brother in hand.
Helen could usually manage him better than any
of the others. She whispered some mysterious
something to him which quickly sobered
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to think I am impertinent
or interfering, but your little brother told me on
the train coming out that your mother and father
were both ill&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I told him they were likely to die mos&rsquo;
any time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I heard at the post-office at Preston,
where I live, that you have rented the farm from
the Misses Grant; also that those ladies were not
expecting you until tomorrow&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But I wrote we would be there today,
Wednesday!&rdquo; exclaimed Douglas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t make a bit of difference to Miss
Ella and Miss Louise Grant,&rdquo; laughed the boy.
&ldquo;They never get anything straight because they
discuss every subject so thoroughly that they are
all mixed up before they get through. Anyhow,
they did not meet you, and if you don&rsquo;t think I
am pushing or forward or something&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Butinsky!&rdquo; suggested Bobby, but Helen
slipped her hand over his pert little mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you for that word&mdash;butinsky&mdash;why,
I should like the privilege of going after your
mother and father and bringing all the luggage
my car will hold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are too kind!&rdquo; chorused the girls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me take all of you first to the farm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must go by Grantly to let the ladies
know we are here,&rdquo; suggested Douglas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are both of them at the farm. I saw
them as I came by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you tell them we had come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! They were sure to let me know it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
none of my business, and, as I was fully aware of
the fact, I just drove on by, hoping to be of more
service to you in this way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls and Bobby piled into the car assisted
by the boy, who handed them in with pleasing
gallantry. By adroit man&oelig;uvering he managed
to get Nan in front, although the irrepressible
did squeeze in, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must sit in front so I can poke out my arm.
Maybe you is huntin&rsquo; a shover. I&rsquo;m Dr.
Wright&rsquo;s shover in town an&rsquo; up&rsquo;n the mountings.
He don&rsquo;t mind my having two jobs in off times
when he ain&rsquo;t a-needin&rsquo; me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I&rsquo;ll employ you right now,&rdquo; said
Billy Sutton, solemnly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think maybe it is in order for us to introduce
ourselves,&rdquo; said Douglas. &ldquo;This is Helen
Carter; and this, Nan; and this, Lucy; I am
Douglas; and Bobby has already been noticed
enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hands were shaken and then they started
gaily off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems a long quarter of a mile from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
station to the farm, but maybe it is because I am
lazy,&rdquo; said Nan, who was unfeignedly glad of a
lift.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who said it was only a quarter of a mile?
It is exactly three quarters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two minutes brought them to the farm gate,
where Billy deposited the occupants of the back
seat. It was decided that Nan and Bobby were
to go on to the station with their new friend and
benefactor and explain him to Mr. and Mrs.
Carter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Douglas, isn&rsquo;t the place sweet? Lucy,
don&rsquo;t you like it?&rdquo; asked Helen as they opened
the big gate that led from the road into the lawn
of their new abode.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great! It looks so romantical.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was so afraid it wasn&rsquo;t going to be as nice
as we thought it was because the real estate
agent was so glib and rattled on so he confused
us. I was afraid he had hypnotized us into liking
it. But it is lovely,&rdquo; and Douglas breathed
a great sigh of relief.</p>

<p>Indeed it was lovely; lovelier, I fancy, than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the real estate agent dreamed. The lawn was
spacious, with soft rolling contours and a few
great trees, some of them centuries old. In the
front a mighty oak stood guard at one corner
and an elm at another. Nearer the house a
straight young ash and a willow oak divided the
honors. At one side of the quaint old house a
great mock orange had established a precedent
for mock oranges and grown into a tree, just to
show what a mock orange is capable of when not
confined to the limitations of a hedge. Its trunk
was gnarled and twisted and because of careful
pruning of lower branches it had grown like a
huge umbrella with limbs curving out from the
parent stem and almost touching the ground all
around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a grand place to play house and tell
secrets!&rdquo; thought Lucy, regretting that thirteen
years old, almost fourteen, was too great an age
to indulge in dolly tea parties.</p>

<p>A grove of gum trees glorified the back yard
with their brilliant October foliage. There
never was such a red as the gum tree boasts and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
these huge specimens were one blaze of color.
The trunks had taken on a hoary tone that contrasted
pleasantly with the warm tints of the
leaves.</p>

<p>The yard contained about four acres enclosed
by a fence that had been covered entirely by
honeysuckle, and even then a few blossoms were
making the air fragrant. In the back there
were several rather tumble-down outhouses, but
these, too, were covered with honeysuckle as
though by a mantle of charity.</p>

<p>The house had been added to from time to
time as the race of overseers had felt the need.
These additions had been made with no thought
of congruity or ornamentation, but since utility
had been the ruling thought the outcome was on
the whole rather artistic. The original house,
built in the first years of the nineteenth century,
had a basement dining-room, a large chamber
over this and two small, low-ceilinged attic
rooms. Later a shed room had been built at one
side in the back, then a two-story addition had
reared itself next to that with no apparent connection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
with the main house, not even a family
resemblance. This two-storied &ldquo;lean-to&rdquo; was
known always as &ldquo;the new house,&rdquo; although it
had been in existence some threescore years.
There were two rooms and two halls in this addition
and it had a front porch all its own. The
old house also boasted a front porch, with a floor
of unplaned boards and posts of rough cedar.
But who minds cedar pillars when Washington&rsquo;s
bower has done its best to cover them up? As
for unplaned boards with cracks between: what
a good place to sweep the dirt!</p>

<p>The green blinds were open all over the house
and windows were raised. As our girls stood on
the lawn drinking in the beauty and peace of the
scene they heard loud and angry voices proceeding
from the basement window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Louise Grant, you are certainly foolish!
Didn&rsquo;t I tell you they wouldn&rsquo;t be coming down
here yesterday? Here you have littered up this
place with flowers and they will all be faded by
tomorrow. I have told you a million times I
read the letter that Douglas Carter wrote and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
she said distinctly she was coming on Thursday.&rdquo;
This in a loud, high, commanding tone
as though the speaker was determined to be
heard. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t put your hands over your
ears! I know you can hear me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Ella Grant,&rdquo; came in full
contralto notes; &ldquo;just because they didn&rsquo;t come
yesterday is no sign they did not say they were
coming that day. I read the note, too, and if
you hadn&rsquo;t have been so quick to burn it I guess
I could prove it. Those flowers are not doing
anybody any harm and I know one thing&mdash;they
smell a sight better than that old carbolic you are
so fond of sprinkling around.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought I heard the three train stop at the
crossing,&rdquo; broke in the high, hard voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No such thing! I noticed particularly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! You were so busy watching that
Sutton boy racing by in his car that you didn&rsquo;t
even know it was train time. What John Sutton
means by letting that boy drive that car I
can&rsquo;t see. He isn&rsquo;t more than fourteen&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fourteen! Ella Grant, you have lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
your senses! He is twenty, if he is a day. I
remember perfectly well that he was born during
the Spanish war.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly! That was just fourteen years
ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls couldn&rsquo;t help laughing. It happened
that it was eighteen years since the Spanish
war, as our history scholar, Lucy, had just
learned. That seemed to be the way the sisters
hit the mark: one shooting far in front, one far
behind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had better knock,&rdquo; whispered Helen,
&ldquo;or they will begin to break up the china soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She accordingly beat a rat-tat on the open
front door of the old house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Someone is knocking!&rdquo; exclaimed the contralto.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all! It&rsquo;s a woodpecker,&rdquo; put in the
treble.</p>

<p>One more application of Helen&rsquo;s knuckles and
treble was convinced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That time it was a knock,&rdquo; she conceded.</p>

<p>There was a hurrying and scurrying, a sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
of altercation on the stairs leading from the
basement to the front hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you try to go first? You know
perfectly well I can go faster than you can, and
here you have started up the steps and I can&rsquo;t
get by. You fat&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you can go so much faster, why didn&rsquo;t you
start up the steps first?&rdquo; panted the contralto.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk or you&rsquo;ll never get up the steps!
Save your wind for climbing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bulky form of Miss Louise hove in sight
and over her shoulder the girls could see the
stern countenance of her long, slim sister. How
could two such different looking persons be born
of one mother? Miss Louise was all breadth
and no height; Miss Ella, all height and no
breadth. Miss Louise was dark of complexion,
with coal-black hair streaked with grey; Miss
Ella was a strawberry blonde with sandy hair
streaked with grey. Age that brought the grey
hair seemed about the only thing they had in
common, except, of course, the estate of Grantly.
That had been willed to them by their father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
with a grim humor, as he must have been well
aware of their idiosyncrasies. They were to
hold the property together with no division, the
one who survived to inherit the whole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Miss Ella over the shoulder of
her sister, who refused to give her right of way
but who was silenced for the moment by shortness
of breath. &ldquo;Why did you come today
when you wrote you were coming to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not write I was coming tomorrow,&rdquo;
said Douglas, smiling in spite of herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There! What did I tell you?&rdquo; panted Miss
Louise. &ldquo;You said Tuesday, didn&rsquo;t you,
honey?&rdquo; with ingratiating sweetness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Miss Grant, I said Wednesday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The incident was closed. The wrangling sisters
had no more to say on the subject except to
apologize for not having them met. It was explained
that Billy Sutton had gone to get Mr.
and Mrs. Carter, but the trunks must be sent for.
Quite humbly Miss Ella went to get her farmhand
to hitch up the mules to drive to the station,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
while Miss Louise showed the girls over the
house.</p>

<p>Everything was in beautiful order and shining
with cleanliness. The white pine floors were
scrubbed until they reminded the girls of biscuit
boards, and very lovely did the bright rag rugs
look on these floors. The furniture was very
plain with the exception of an occasional bit of
fine old mahogany. A beautiful old highboy
was not too proud to stay in the same room with
a cheap oak dresser, and in the basement dining-room
a handsome mahogany table democratically
mingled with split-bottom chairs.</p>

<p>Miss Louise had put flowers everywhere for
their reception the day before and the whole
house was redolent of late roses and mignonette
and citronella. An occasional whiff of carbolic
acid and chloride of lime gave evidence of the
indomitable practicality of Miss Ella.</p>

<p>Miss Louise proved very sweet and kindly
when not in her sister&rsquo;s presence and later on the
girls found Miss Ella to be really very agreeable.
Both ladies seemed to be bent on showing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
kindness and consideration to their tenants to
make up for the mistake about their day of arrival.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Carter could not help thinking
that the place their daughters had chosen for
them to spend the winter was pretty. As they
rolled up in Billy&rsquo;s car the quaint house and
beautiful lawn certainly presented a most pleasing
aspect, and their handsome daughters were
an added loveliness to the landscape as they hurried
to meet their parents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, this is great!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Carter,
taking a deep breath of the pure fresh air. &ldquo;I
think I shall have to have a cow and some pigs
and do some fall plowing besides. Eh, Helen?
You and I are to be the stay-at-homes. What
do you think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think what you think, Daddy,&rdquo; answered
Helen, smiling happily over her father&rsquo;s show
of enthusiasm. Dr. Wright had told her that
with returning healthy nerves would come the
enthusiasm that before his illness had seemed to
be part of Robert Carter&rsquo;s make-up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you like it, Mumsy?&rdquo; asked Douglas
as she drew her arm through her mother&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very nice, I am sure, but I think it would
be wiser for me to go to bed now. I am not very
strong and if I can give up before I drop it
would be less trouble for my family,&rdquo; and Mrs.
Carter took on a most plaintive accent. &ldquo;A little
tea and toast will be all I want for my
supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh now, it will be too bad for you to go to
bed,&rdquo; said Miss Ella. &ldquo;We were planning to
have all of you come up to Grantly for supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She and Miss Louise seemed to have agreed
for once on the propriety of having their tenants
to supper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The count is coming,&rdquo; said Miss Louise,
with a sentimental note in her full voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The count! Who is the count?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
Carter with some show of animation and interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a nobleman who has settled in our
neighborhood,&rdquo; said Miss Ella in a matter-of-fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
tone, as though noblemen were the rule
rather than the exception in her life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe it would be possible for me to take a
short rest and come to Grantly,&rdquo; said Mrs. Carter,
with a quickening in her pretty eyes.</p>

<p>At mention of the count, Billy Sutton pretended
to be much occupied with his engine, but
Nan noticed a slight curl on his lip as he bent
over the wheel.</p>

<hr class="l1" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="f8">THE COUNT</span></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it fine not to have to bother about supper?&rdquo;
said Helen, as she and Douglas were attempting
to get some order out of the chaos of
trunks that had been brought from the station
and systematically put in the wrong place by the
good-natured, shambling, inefficient darky who
served as factotum to the Misses Grant.</p>

<p>Helen and Douglas had decided to take one
attic room in the old house for their bedroom;
Bobby was to have the other; the large chamber
below them was to serve as family sitting-room;
Nan and Lucy were to have the upstairs room in
the new house; Mr. and Mrs. Carter the lower
room; the shed room was to serve as guest chamber
when needed; the dining-room was in the
basement. Over the outside kitchen was another
extremely low attic room that was to be
the servant&rsquo;s bedroom, when they got her. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
room was accessible from the kitchen by a flight
of primitive chicken steps, that is, accessible to
the young and agile.</p>

<p>The two servants the Carters had had at the
week-end camp had been eager to come with
them to the country, but Douglas and Helen had
decided that they were expensive luxuries, and
as much as they hated to part with them, had
determined to have a country girl, accustomed to
less wages than Susan, and to do without a manservant
in place of the faithful, if high-priced,
Oscar. Dr. Wright had insisted that some
chores were indispensable for Mr. Carter, such
as chopping wood, carrying water, etc., and that
gentleman was eager to assist wherever he could.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely you are not going to dress up to go
out to supper this evening,&rdquo; said Douglas, as
Helen shook out a pretty little old-rose dinner
gown, a leftover from the time when the Carters
purchased clothes for every occasion and for
every passing style and season.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to dress suitably, but I don&rsquo;t call
it dressing up,&rdquo; said Helen, hunting for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
stockings to match the gown. &ldquo;I think Father
is well enough for me to wear silk stockings this
evening,&rdquo; she said a little wistfully. We all remember
that in the first throes of agony over her
father&rsquo;s nervous breakdown Helen had taken an
oath not to wear silk stockings until he was well.
&ldquo;What do you think, Douglas?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, you goose, just so you don&rsquo;t have
to buy the stockings,&rdquo; laughed Douglas. &ldquo;I
am going to wear what I have on, I can tell you
that. There is a lot to do to get the beds made
up and the house ready to sleep in, and I have
no idea of unpacking my own trunk until tomorrow,&rdquo;
and Douglas unlocked the trunk that
held the bed linen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Douglas, please put on your grey crêpe
de chine! I&rsquo;ll get it out for you and find your
stockings and everything,&rdquo; begged Helen. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think it is very respectful to our hostesses
for you not to be suitably dressed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it altogether our hostesses you are thinking
about?&rdquo; teased Douglas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whom else should I consider?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How about the count?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, naturally I can&rsquo;t help thinking some
about a nobleman,&rdquo; declared Helen frankly.
&ldquo;Do you fancy he is young or old, rich or poor,
handsome or ugly? I am wild to see him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine. They didn&rsquo;t even say what
he was a count of. I hope he is not German. I
must say I&rsquo;d hate to put on my best dress for a
German count,&rdquo; laughed Douglas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Douglas, I wouldn&rsquo;t be so biased as
all that. As long as our country is neutral, I
don&rsquo;t think it is fair for us to take such a stand.
I&rsquo;d rather dress up for a German count than&mdash;than&mdash;a
Russian anarchist or maybe an Australian
Bushman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I am not pining to dress up for anybody,
but if I must, I must. How about
Mumsy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has already got out her black lace and is
going to wear her pearls. She is trying to persuade
Father into his tuxedo but I fancy he will
rebel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mercy on us! I thought we would never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
have to dress in this out-of-the-way spot,&rdquo; sighed
Douglas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I for one am glad to have a chance to
dress. It seems to me we have been khakied to
death all summer, and I believe people deteriorate
when they stay in the same old clothes year
in and year out. I could wish my old-rose had
another width in it. Skirts are much broader
this fall. The sleeves are quite right, though,&mdash;sleeves
haven&rsquo;t changed much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Helen! It was a keen misery to her not
to be in the latest style. She had a natural taste
for dress and the tendency to overrate the importance
of clothes had been fostered in her by her
frivolous mother. Douglas, on the other hand,
had a tendency to underrate the value of dress
and her inclination was to be rather careless of
her attire.</p>

<p>After much scrabbling and stirring up of
trunks the whole family was dressed in what
Mrs. Carter and Helen considered suitable garments,
with the exception of Mr. Carter, who
could not be coerced into a dinner coat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think that a quiet supper in the country
with two old ladies who are renting us the
overseer&rsquo;s cottage could possibly call for formal
dressing. Of course, you women know best
what you want to wear, and very handsome all
of you look I am sure, but you must excuse
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I say!&rdquo; exclaimed Bobby, putting
his hands in his pockets and trying to balance
himself with his feet very far apart.
&ldquo;Me&rsquo;n Father certainly do nachelly hate clean
clothes. When I gits to be growed up, I&rsquo;m
gonter be a barefoot tramp an&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t never gonter
wash nor nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo; Bobby was still smarting
and indignant from the polishing Helen had
seemed to think the occasion demanded, especially
concentrating on his long-suffering ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes I wisht I hadn&rsquo;t never had my
curls cut off. Folks weren&rsquo;t near so &rsquo;ticular
&rsquo;bout my yers when I had curls. They kinder
hid &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Bobby, when you are going to have
supper with a count you must be very carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
dressed,&rdquo; explained Lucy. &ldquo;Counts are not
just common persons like us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you I&rsquo;m no common person,&rdquo;
drawled Nan. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a good American and fit
to dine with any count living. That&rsquo;s the way
Douglas and I feel. We wouldn&rsquo;t have changed
our dresses if Mother and Helen hadn&rsquo;t made
such a point of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Nan!&rdquo; and her father put his
arm around her. &ldquo;Of course you must dress as
your mother sees fit, but don&rsquo;t, for goodness&rsquo;
sake, think a man, because he is a count or even a
king, must be treated differently from any other
gentleman of your acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were on their way to Grantly, only
about five minutes&rsquo; walk from the farmhouse.
The sun had set in a blaze of glory but already
the great October moon was doing her best to
take his place. There was a hint of frost in the
air and our Carters were bringing their appetites
with them to grace the board of their hospitable
landladies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do hope Miss Ella and Miss Louise won&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
quarrel all the time,&rdquo; whispered Helen as they
approached the imposing mansion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They remind me of the blue and white
seidlitz powders,&rdquo; said Douglas: &ldquo;bound to
sizzle when you mix &rsquo;em. They are so mild and
gentle when they are apart and the minute they
get together&mdash;whiz!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter cast a triumphant glance at her
husband as they entered the parlor at Grantly.
The Misses Grant were dressed in rustling black
silk with old lace berthas and cuffs, and the gentleman
who sprang to his feet, bringing his heels
together with a click as he bowed low, was attired
in a faultlessly fitting dress suit.</p>

<p>Helen&rsquo;s questions were answered by one
glance at this distinguished stranger; certainly
he was young and handsome; the chances were
that he was also not poor. That cut of dress
suit did not go with poverty, nor did the exquisite
fineness of his linen. Douglas&rsquo;s question of his
nationality remained to be solved. &ldquo;Count de
Lestis&rdquo; did not give the girls a clue to the country
from which this interesting person hailed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He does not look German,&rdquo; Douglas said
to herself. &ldquo;He is too dark and too graceful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She breathed a sigh of relief that her grey
crêpe de chine had not been donned in honor of a
German, count or no count. When she saw that
the Misses Grant evidently considered their suppers
worthy to be dressed up for, she was glad
she had listened to the dictates of Helen.</p>

<p>That young lady was looking especially
charming in the old-rose gown, in spite of the
fact that the skirt did not flare quite enough.
Helen had a way of wearing her clothes and of
arranging her hair that many a dame at Palm
Beach or Newport would have given her fortune
to possess.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter always was at her best in a parlor
and now her beauty shone resplendent, framed in
black lace and pearls. Her gracious manner
and bearing marked her as one whose natural
place was in society. Her gift was social and it
did seem a great waste that such a talent should
have to be buried under the bushel of an overseer&rsquo;s
cottage in an out-of-the-way spot in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
country, with a once prosperous husband to do
the chores and a maid-of-all-work, chosen because
of her cheapness and not her worth.</p>

<p>The Misses Grant smiled their approval over
the appearance of their guests. The fact that
they were two quarrelsome old sisters farming
on a dwindling estate did not lessen their importance
in their own eyes, and they always felt
that the dignity of Grantly demanded ceremonial
dressing for the evening meal.</p>

<p>The sisters showed no marks of having toiled
through the entire afternoon to prepare the feast
that they were to set before their guests. Disagreeing
as they did on every subject, food was
not exempt. If Miss Ella decided to make an
angel&rsquo;s food cake, Miss Louise must make a
devil&rsquo;s food cake; if one thought the whites of
eggs left from the frozen custard would be well
to use in a silver cake, the other simultaneously
determined to have apple float, requiring whites
of eggs, and then the yolks must be converted
into golden cake. The consequence was that
their supper table groaned with opposing dishes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Each one pressed upon the guests her own specialty,
and if it so happened that Miss Ella had
to serve some dish of Miss Louise&rsquo;s concocting,
she would do it with a deprecating air as though
she were helping you to cold poison; and if Miss
Louise perforce must hand you one of Miss
Ella&rsquo;s muffins, she would shake her head mysteriously
as though to warn you against
them.</p>

<p>One thing was apparent from the beginning
and that was that the count was a good mixer.
His English was perfect, except for an occasional
suggestion of an interchange of b and p,
and also a too great stress on his s. He was a
brilliant conversationalist but had the wit not to
be a monologueist. He had done much traveling
for a man under thirty and had lived in so many
places that it made him a real citizen of the
world. Evidently he had the Misses Grant
charmed. From the moment that he bought
Weston, a fine old estate in the neighborhood,
and came into their county to settle, the old
ladies had taken him to their hearts. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
seemed in danger of agreeing on the subject of
this fascinating young man&rsquo;s charms. However,
they found something to quarrel about even in
this stranger: Miss Ella thought his mouth was
his best feature, while Miss Louise insisted that
his eyes were.</p>

<p>Of course the Carters were one and all dying
to know more about him: Who was he? What
was his nationality? Why had he settled in
America? Where were his people? Did he
have a family?</p>

<p>He seemed to be equally curious about them.
Why should city people of such breeding and
beauty come and live in a little tumbledown
shack in the country? He had merely been told
by the Misses Grant that the tenants who had
just moved into the little farmhouse were to have
supper with them, when these visions of loveliness
burst upon him. He couldn&rsquo;t decide which
one of the sisters was the most attractive.
Douglas was the most beautiful with her titian
hair and clear complexion, not ruined by the
summer out-of-doors as her mother had feared.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
But Helen&mdash;there was a piquancy about Helen
that was certainly very fetching; her brown hair
was so beautifully arranged at exactly the right
and becoming angle; her little head was so
gracefully set on her athletic shoulders; her
bearing was so gallant;&mdash;certainly Helen was
very attractive. Then there was Nan with her
soft loveliness, her great eyes now shining with
excitement and now dreaming some entrancing
dream. She was only sixteen but there was
something about her countenance that gave
promise of great cleverness. Lucy was growing
more like Helen and much of Helen&rsquo;s charm
was hers, although the child had strong characteristics
all her own.</p>

<p>While Count de Lestis was deciding which
one of the sisters was most attractive, he did the
extremely tactful and suitable thing of addressing
his remarks to their mother, not forgetting
to give the hostesses a full share of attention.
Mr. Carter, who since his illness had been inclined
to be very quiet, was drawn into the conversation
and held his own with his old time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
power. Little wonder that his daughters were
grateful to this interesting stranger who had this
effect on their beloved father.</p>

<p>The young man told them he was Hungarian
and had bought the estate of Weston with a view
to entering into intensive farming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you are not Prussian!&rdquo; exclaimed
Douglas. &ldquo;Oh, I am so glad!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; and his handsome eyes flashed for a
moment. Then he looked amused. &ldquo;And why
are you so glad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course anyone would be glad,&rdquo; and
Douglas blushed. &ldquo;Who would want to have
a Prussian for a neighbor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you dislike them so much then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hate them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you, too?&rdquo; turning to Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am trying to remain neutral as our president
has asked us to. I don&rsquo;t feel so terribly
Anglo-Saxon as my sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course this started the question of the war,
which was in the minds of everybody. Count
de Lestis rather surprised Mr. Carter by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
frank announcement concerning his connection
with Berlin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I, no doubt, would be fighting with the
Central Powers if I had not committed political
suicide four years ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how was that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wrote a book in which I made a plea for a
democratization of Austria-Hungary. In it I
intimated that the Hohenzollerns had no right to
dictate to the universe. I was requested to leave
the country. I was then living in Vienna, making
short trips to my estate, which lies partly in
Austria and partly in Hungary. Now there is
danger of my entire possessions being confiscated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but when Germany is finally whipped
you can come into your own again,&rdquo; asserted
Douglas. &ldquo;The outcome is merely a matter of
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so Germany is to be whipped?&rdquo; his eyes
flashing again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Douglas simply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why of course?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Because God&rsquo;s in his Heaven,&rsquo;&rdquo; whispered
Nan, but the count heard her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but whose God?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The God of Justice and of Right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How about the God of Might?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no such God,&rdquo; and this time Douglas&rsquo;s
eyes did some flashing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe the United States will intervene
before so very long,&rdquo; said Mr. Carter as he and
the count strolled out on the veranda to enjoy
their cigars. The older man was enjoying his
talk with this young foreigner. He looked forward
with pleasure to seeing much of him, since
Weston was only about three miles from the
farm. They made plans to do some shooting
together, as the open season was only a week
off.</p>

<p>When de Lestis learned that Mr. Carter was
an architect he asked him to visit him at his
earliest convenience at Weston to advise with
him concerning the restoration of the old house
to its original grandeur.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not supposed to be doing any work for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
at least a year,&rdquo; sighed Mr. Carter, &ldquo;but I
might look it over and tell you what I think and
then recommend a suitable architect to take it
in hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Douglas and Helen had a talk with Miss
Louise on the subject of a country girl to come
to them as maid of all work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are all of them thoroughly trifling,&rdquo;
declared that lady in her soft round voice, &ldquo;but
this creature we have has a sister who could come
to you. I beg of you not to give her any more
wages than ours receives, as in that case we
should have to go up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; said Douglas. &ldquo;Just tell us
what that is.&rdquo; But on learning that it was only
seven dollars a month, the girls felt that it was
no wonder the creatures were thoroughly trifling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did she cook this wonderful supper?&rdquo; asked
Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed! Ella and I always cook everything
we eat and this Tempy washes the dishes
and cleans.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But we want someone to cook. Do you
think I might train the sister?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I have heard you can train monkeys
but I have never seen it done,&rdquo; laughed the fat
old lady. &ldquo;Come with me now and we can
speak to Tempy about her sister Chloe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They found Tempy in the pantry, peacefully
sleeping in the midst of the unwashed dishes.
Not in the least abashed at being caught napping,
she waked up and told Helen that no
doubt Chloe would be pleased fur ter come. She
promised to fetch her on the morrow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will pay her just what the Misses Grant
pay you,&rdquo; said Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lawsamussy, missy, she ain&rsquo;t wuth what I
is. She ain&rsquo;t nebber wucked out ter say much.
I done started at six and wucked up ter seben,
an&rsquo; if Chloe gits now what I gits, she&rsquo;ll be too
proudified. You jis&rsquo; start her at six same as
Miss Ellanlouise done me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

<span class="f8">GRANTLY</span></h2>


<p>Since our girls were to become quite intimate
with the peculiar old sisters and their home, perhaps
it would be just as well for me to give my
readers some idea of what Grantly was like.</p>

<p>The first thing that struck a visitor was the
wonderful box bushes in the hedge enclosing the
yard and in a labyrinth in the garden. These
bushes were so thick that one could really walk
on the tops of them if they were kept clipped,
which they were not. In the labyrinth the bushes
met overhead and even after a heavy rain the
paths between were perfectly dry. It took days
of soaking rain to make those winding paths wet.
Beyond the labyrinth was an old-fashioned garden,
but now in October chrysanthemums and
late roses and cosmos were all that was left of the
riot of color that could be seen there during the
spring and summer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>The house was of a very peculiar architectural
design: a long, low body with a tower at each
end. In each tower was a square room with
many windows overlooking the country for
miles around. Miss Ella claimed one of these
rooms as her own especial property; Miss Louise
the other. To approach Miss Ella&rsquo;s sanctum
sanctorum it was necessary to climb a narrow
spiral stairway; Miss Louise&rsquo;s was more accessible
by reason of a broad stairway of many
landings, but the ceilings at the landings were
so low that anyone of ordinary stature must
stoop to ascend.</p>

<p>These rooms were used only as sitting-rooms
by the erratic sisters as, strange to say, the two
old ladies slept in the same room and in the same
great four-posted tester bed. There were many
other bedrooms in the mansion, but they both
preferred the great chamber leading from the
parlor, and there they slept and no doubt
quarreled in their sleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is my sitting-room up here,&rdquo; said Miss
Ella as she showed her guests over the quaint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
old house. &ldquo;You may come up if you like. I
had the steps made this way so Louise can&rsquo;t get
up here and worry my soul out of me with her
eternal chatter. She&rsquo;s too fat for the spiral stairway.
Elephant!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and my sitting-room is in the other
tower, and thank goodness, Ella would find it a
back-breaking job to get up my steps,&rdquo; retaliated
Miss Louise. &ldquo;Giraffe!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Those strange old ladies had actually had the
original steps to the towers changed to suit their
particular grouches! They really spent very little
time in their tower fastnesses, however, as
they were much happier when together and quarreling.</p>

<p>A tale was told in the neighborhood that once
Miss Ella had neglected or forgotten to contradict
Miss Louise on some vital subject such as
whether it was or was not going to rain, and
Miss Louise was so uneasy that she sent post
haste for Dr. Allison.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was afraid it was a stroke or something,&rdquo;
whimpered Miss Louise. She worried herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
into a sick headache before the doctor arrived,
and then the fat one had to go to bed and take the
medicine and Miss Ella was forced to repent of
her misbehavior by nursing her sister. Dr. Allison
left strict injunctions that she was not to
worry her poor sister again by agreeing with
her.</p>

<p>Grantly was filled with fine old furniture and
all kinds of curios. A great-uncle had been a
traveler in the Orient and many were the teakwood
cabinets and jade ornaments; curious
Japanese prints; Chinese embroidered fans and
screens; bronze Buddhas; rare vases with inlaid
flowers and birds; Toby jugs and lacquered teapots;
quaint armor, swords and daggers; everything
in fact that might be found in an old house
that a traveler had once called home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does Tempy dust all these beautiful
things?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Carter, who was quite carried
away by the wonders in her landladies&rsquo;
home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless you, no! She doesn&rsquo;t dare to touch a
one of them,&rdquo; laughed Miss Louise. &ldquo;Ella<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
dusts the high ones, I dust the low.&rdquo; She said
it quite with the air of the song:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;You take the high road,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I&rsquo;ll take the low.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>With all of its beauties, Grantly was undergoing
a process of slow decay. Lack of paint
and neglected leaks were getting in their insidious
work. There never seemed to be money
enough for the owners to afford the needed repairs,
and if there ever was any money at all,
they could never come to an agreement on which
repairs were the most urgent.</p>

<p>The overseer&rsquo;s house was suffering in the same
way. A kind of dry rot had attacked portions of
it. Weather-boarding was so loose in places
that Bobby could pull it off. Steps groaned and
floors creaked; shutters had lost fastenings;
putty had dropped from the window panes,
which were insecurely held in place with tacks;
mop-boarding and floors had parted company
many years before. All of these little details
had escaped the inexperienced eyes of Douglas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and Helen when they decided that this was the
place of all others to spend the winter. Dr.
Wright, who had accompanied them, had been
more noticing, but had wisely decided to say
nothing, as he wanted his patient to become interested
in tinkering at small jobs, and he could
see that this little farm would keep Mr. Carter
busy.</p>

<p>The ladies of Grantly had promised to have
everything in order before the tenants should arrive,
but disagreeing on which workman they
should employ, the time had slipped by and
nothing had been done.</p>

<p>The pump to the well had lost its sucker and
had to be primed before water could be got.
This meant that the person who pumped must
remember to fill a can of water and leave it for
the next pumper. The yard gate shut with difficulty
and opened with more. The stovepipe in
the kitchen had a large hole in one side and if the
wind shifted, so did the smoke, seeking an outlet
through the nearest aperture.</p>

<p>All of these disagreeable features dawned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
gradually on our girls. They saw nothing to be
complained of in those rare October days. Accustomed
as they had become to camp life, they
made light of any inconveniences. Their father
was happy and getting better every day, so any
small hardships that might fall to their share
were to be lightly borne.</p>

<hr class="l1" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />

<span class="f8">VALHALLA</span></h2>


<p>That was the name Nan gave to the little
winter home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Valhalla is the place where the dead warriors
go, and that is what we all of us are after
the day&rsquo;s work is done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Commuting at first was very tiring for both
Nan and Lucy. Catching trains was hard on
their nerves and the trip seemed interminable,
but in a few weeks they fell into the attitude of
mind of all commuters and just accepted it as
part of the daily routine. It became no more
irksome than doing one&rsquo;s hair or brushing one&rsquo;s
teeth.</p>

<p>The girls made many friends on the train and
before the winter was over really enjoyed the
time spent going to and from school. Billy Sutton
was Nan&rsquo;s devoted cavalier. He managed,
if possible, to sit by her and together they would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
study. He helped her with her mathematics,
and she, quick at languages, would correct his
French exercises. Those were sad mornings for
Billy when the seat by Nan was taken before they
reached Preston. He cursed his luck that Preston
should not have been beyond Grantly instead
of a station nearer to town. Coming home
he always saw to it that no &ldquo;fresh kid&rdquo; got
ahead of him in the choice of seats. He would
get to the station ahead of time and watch with
eagle eye for Nan&rsquo;s sedate little figure; then he
would pounce on her like a veritable eagle and
possess himself of her books and parcels. Thereafter
no power could have separated him from
her short of the brakeman who cruelly called
out: &ldquo;P-errr-reston!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Billy&rsquo;s younger sister Mag was of great assistance
to her big brother in his man&oelig;uvres.
She struck up a warm friendship with Lucy, and
since the two younger girls were together, what
more natural than that he and Nan should be the
same?</p>

<p>&ldquo;How would you like me to run you over to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
see Lucy for a while this afternoon?&rdquo; he would
ask in the lordly and nonchalant manner of big
brothers, and Mag would be duly grateful, all
the time laughing in her sleeve, as is the way with
small sisters.</p>

<p>The only person who ever got ahead of Billy
on the homeward voyage was Count de Lestis.
That man of the world with lordly condescension
permitted Billy to carry all the books and parcels
and then quietly appropriated the seat by
Nan. That was hard enough, but what was
harder was to see how Nan dimpled under the
compliments the count paid her, and how gaily
she laughed at his wit, and how easily she held
her own in the very interesting conversation into
which they plunged. Billy, boiling and raging,
could not help catching bits of it. Actually Nan
was quoting poetry to the handsome foreigner.
With wonder her schoolboy friend heard her
telling the count of how she had gone up in an
aeroplane the preceding summer and what her
sensations were. She had never told him all
these things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And why is it you like so much to fly?&rdquo; the
count asked. &ldquo;Is it merely the physical sensation?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, there is something else. I&rsquo;ll tell you
a little bit of poetry I learned the other day from
a magazine. That is the way I feel, somehow:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Tomorrow, or the next day, or maybe the day after!&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Nan Carter was a very charming girl at any
time, but Nan Carter reciting poetry was irresistible.
So the count found her. Her eyes
looked more like forest pools than ever and the
trembling Billy was very much afraid the handsome
nobleman was going to fall into said pools.
He gritted his teeth with the determination to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
on the spot ready to pull him out by his aristocratic
and well-shod heels if he should take such
a tumble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, you have the wanderlust, too! I&rsquo;d like
to go with you to your Land o&rsquo; Dreaming.&rdquo;
Fortunately Billy did not hear this remark, as
the brakeman opened the door at this juncture
and shouted the name of a station.</p>

<p>For once Billy was glad when the brakeman
finally called: &ldquo;P-err-reston!&rdquo; If he had to get
out, so had the hated count. He never had
taken as much of a fancy to de Lestis as the other
members of the neighborhood had, anyhow, and
now he knew why he had never liked him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a selfish, arrogant foreigner,&rdquo; he raged
on in his boyish way. &ldquo;He might have let me
sit with Nan part of the way, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan went home quite pleased with the interesting
conversation she had had on the train.
The count was rapidly becoming a warm friend
of the family. Everybody liked him but Lucy,
and she had no especial reason for disliking him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got no time for me and I guess that&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the reason,&rdquo; she said when questioned. &ldquo;Mag
doesn&rsquo;t cotton to him much, either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I should think you would be glad for
Father to have somebody to talk to,&rdquo; said Helen.
&ldquo;You and Mag are too young to have much in
common with a grown-up gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pooh, Miss Grandmother! I&rsquo;m most as old
as Nan and he cottons to her for fair. I know
why he doesn&rsquo;t think much of Mag and me&mdash;it
is because he knows we know he is nothing but a
Dutchman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dutchman! Nonsense! Dutchmen proper
come from Holland and Count de Lestis is a
Hungarian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he can talk Dutch like a Prussian,
anyhow. You oughter hear him jabbering with
that German family that live over near Preston.
He brings old Mr. Blitz newspapers all the time
and they laugh and laugh over jokes in them; at
least, they must be jokes to make them laugh
so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course the count speaks German. He
speaks a great many languages,&rdquo; declared Helen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
with the dignified air that she thought necessary
to assume when she and Lucy got in a discussion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the reason he ain&rsquo;t fighting for
his country? Tell me that! Mag says that Billy
says that if his country was at war you wouldn&rsquo;t
catch him buying farms in strange countries, like
this de Lestis. He says he&rsquo;d be in the fight, if
he couldn&rsquo;t do anything but beat a drum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you see he is not in sympathy with the
cause, child. All of the Austrians and Hungarians
are not on the Kaiser&rsquo;s side. A whole
lot of them believe in a more democratic form of
government than Emperor William wants.
The count explained all that to Father. He says
he could not conscientiously fight with Prussia
against democracy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All that sounds mighty fine but I like men
that fight,&rdquo; and Lucy tossed her head. &ldquo;Me
and Mag both like men that fight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mag and I,&rdquo; admonished Helen.</p>

<p>The gentleman in question had just been off
on a business trip. He had much business in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
New York and Washington and sometimes
made flying visits to Chicago. He was interested
in a land agency and was hoping to import
some Hungarian and Serbian families to the
United States. He had bought up quite a tract
of land in Virginia, making cash payments that
showed he had unlimited means.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They make excellent servants,&rdquo; he told the
Misses Grant, &ldquo;far superior to your negroes.
The Serbs are especially fine farmers. It is
really a nation of yeomen. They could make
the barren tracts of Virginia blossom like the
rose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, bring them over then.&rdquo; The sisters almost
agreed about this but they had a diverging
point in that Miss Ella thought she would rather
have a family of Hungarians, since that was the
count&rsquo;s nationality; while Miss Louise fancied
some Serbs, because they were at least fighting
on the side of the Allies.</p>

<p>But to return to &ldquo;Valhalla.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Douglas did not at all approve of the name
Nan had given the little home. &ldquo;I am not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
dead warrior when the day is over nor do I mean
to be one ever,&rdquo; she declared.</p>

<p>She started in on her winter of teaching with
all the energy and vim of the proverbial new
broom. She gloried in the fact that she was able
to turn her education to some account; and
while the remuneration of a country school
teacher is certainly not munificent, it helped a
great deal towards the family expenses.</p>

<p>The rent from the Carters&rsquo; pretty home in
Richmond was all they had to live on now, except
for a small sum in bank left over from the
camp earnings. It would be possible to manage
if no clothes had to be bought, and one and
all promised to do with last year&rsquo;s suits.</p>

<p>Only a born teacher could make a real success
of a country school where thirty children must be
taught in all grades up to high-school standing.
It took infinite patience, boundless good humor,
and a systematic saving of time, together with a
keen sense of fun to get Douglas over each day.
She found the school in a state of insurrection,
due to having proved too much for the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
teacher, who had found urgent business elsewhere,
and then for a series of substitutes until
the present incumbent, Miss Douglas Carter,
was installed.</p>

<p>She made a little speech the first morning, telling
the pupils quite frankly that this was her
first year of teaching but that it was not going
to be her last; that she was determined to make
good and she asked their help; that she was willing
to give them all she had in the way of knowledge
and strength but that they must meet her
half-way and do their best. She gave them to
understand from the very first that she intended
to have good order and that obedience was to
be the first lesson taught.</p>

<p>Most of the children fell into her plans with
enthusiasm. Of course there were the reactionaries
who had to be dealt with summarily.
Bobby was one of them. He was very difficult
to manage in school. Never having been under
the least restraint before in all of his seven years,
it was hard on him to have to sit still and pretend
to study, and he made it harder on Douglas.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
The faction opposed to government in any
form egged him on. They laughed at his impertinent
remarks to the teacher and bribed him
to do and say many outrageous things.</p>

<p>Poor Douglas was tempted to confess herself
beaten as far as her little brother was concerned
and give up trying to teach him. He was rather
young for school, she almost fooled herself into
believing; but there was a sturdiness and determination
in Douglas Carter&rsquo;s make-up that
would not let her succumb to difficulties.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will succeed! He shall learn! My pupils
must respect me, and if I can&rsquo;t make my own
little brother obey me, how can I expect to control
the rest of them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She asked herself what she would do with any
other pupil, not her brother, who gave her so
much trouble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Write a note to his mother or father, of
course,&rdquo; she answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t bear to bother Father, and
Mother would blame me and no doubt pet
Bobby. I&rsquo;ll write a note to Dr. Wright and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
disapproval will hurt Bobby more than anything
that could happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so she wrote the following letter to
Bobby&rsquo;s employer:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right in2"><i>Preston, Va., R.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;D. Route 1.<br />
November 1, 1916.</i><br /></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Dr. Wright</span>:</p>

<p>I am sorry to inform you that your
chauffeur, Robert Carter, Jr., is misbehaving at
school in such a way that his teacher is afraid he
will have to be expelled. She has done everything
in her power to make him be more considerate
but he is very, very naughty and tries to
worry his teacher all the time.</p>

<p><span class="sign2">Very sincerely,</span><br />
<span class="sign1">Douglas Carter.</span><br /></p>
</div>

<p>Dr. Wright telephoned that he would be
down to see them on Saturday after receiving
Douglas&rsquo;s note; but the message was sent via
Grantly, as the Carters had no telephone, and
Miss Ella and Miss Louise could not agree just
what his name was or when he said he was coming.
So the matter was lost sight of in the
wrangle that ensued and the word was not delivered
until too late.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

<span class="f8">CHLOE</span></h2>


<p>To Helen had fallen the most difficult and
trying part of the program: training a cheap,
country servant to the ways of civilization.
Many times did she think of Miss Louise&rsquo;s
trained monkey as she labored with Chloe, with
whom she had to start all over every day.</p>

<p>A seven o&rsquo;clock breakfast must be ready for
Nan and Lucy, and the one morning that she
left it to Chloe the girls had to go off with nothing
more comforting on their little insides than
cold bread and milk. That was when the new
maid had first arrived and Helen had not
sounded the depths of her incompetence and ignorance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would you have done in your own
home if you had had to have an early breakfast
for someone?&rdquo; asked Helen, curious to know if
the girl knew how to do anything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; done what I done this mornin&rsquo;: let &rsquo;um
fill up on what col&rsquo; victuals they was lef&rsquo; on de
she&rsquo;f.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen endeavored to introduce Chloe to the
mysteries of the fireless cooker, which they had
brought with them from camp, but the girl
seemed to think there was some kind of magic in
a thing that cooked without fire and would none
of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; ter tetch no sich hoodoo doin&rsquo;s
as dat &rsquo;ere box,&rdquo; she asserted. &ldquo;It mus&rsquo; hab a
kinder debble in it ter keep it hot &rsquo;thout a piece
er dry wood or nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen was lifting out the pot full of steaming
oatmeal that she had put in the cooker the night
before, determined that her sisters should not
have to go off again with such cold comfort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, you keep up the wood fire and I&rsquo;ll
attend to the fireless cooker,&rdquo; laughed Helen.
&ldquo;What makes the stove smoke? It was burning
all right yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Smoking &rsquo;cause dat hoodoo debble done got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
in it,&rdquo; and Chloe rolled her great eyes until nothing
showed but the whites.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Smoking because you&rsquo;ve got the damper
turned down,&rdquo; and Helen righted the appliance.
&ldquo;Have you set the table?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yassum!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put everything on it just as I showed you
yesterday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nom! I ain&rsquo;t put nothin&rsquo; on it. I jes&rsquo; sot
the cheers up to it, but all the gals is got ter do
is jes&rsquo; retch the things off&rsquo;n the sidebo&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That meant that Helen must run and get the
table set as quickly as possible as it was three
minutes to seven.</p>

<p>Chloe followed her meekly to the dining-room
to do her bidding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run back to the kitchen, Chloe, and look at
the biscuit, and see if they are burning,&rdquo; cried
Helen as she rapidly placed the silver on the
table.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, having set the table she
hastened to the kitchen. An ominous odor
greeted her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Chloe, did you look at the biscuit?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yassum! They was gettin&rsquo; ready to burn.
I guess they is &rsquo;bout burned by now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Chloe, why didn&rsquo;t you take them out?&rdquo;
and poor Helen thought maybe she was going
to weep with exasperation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You nebber tol&rsquo; me ter do mo&rsquo;n look at &rsquo;em.
My maw an&rsquo; Sis Tempy both done caution me
not to be too frisky &rsquo;bout doin&rsquo; things &rsquo;til the
white folks tells me. Tempy says white folks
laks ter boss &rsquo;bout ev&rsquo;ything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, for a trained monkey!&rdquo; thought Helen.
&ldquo;I could at least give one a good switching.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chloe had only two characteristics to work on:
one was perfect good-nature, the other unbounded
health and strength. Helen wondered
if she had enough material to go on to evolve
even a passable servant. Anyhow she meant to
try. She determined to do the cooking herself
for a little while with Chloe as scullion, and also
to have the girl do the housework.</p>

<p>Of course Mrs. Carter was of absolutely no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
assistance. She held to her purpose of semi-invalidism.
The family would not listen to her
when she offered the only sane suggestion for
the winter: that they should oust the tenant and
move back into their own pretty, comfortable,
well-furnished home; Douglas to make her
début in Richmond society and the other girls
continue at school. As for money&mdash;why not
just make bills? They had perfectly good
credit, and what was credit for but to use? Dr.
Wright had been so stern with her, and Douglas
so severe and unfilial, and they had intimated
that she wanted to kill her dear Robert, so she
had just let them have their own way. She insisted
she had not the strength to cope with these
changed conditions and took on the habits of an
invalid.</p>

<p>Helen, remembering how Susan, who was
supposed to help with the cooking at the camp,
had been kept busy waiting on her mistress,
feared Chloe would be pressed into lady&rsquo;s maid
service, too. Indeed Mrs. Carter attempted it,
but Chloe proved too rough for the job, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
poor lady was forced to run the ribbons in her
lingerie herself.</p>

<p>Chloe&rsquo;s cleaning was even worse than her
cooking if such a thing was possible. She spread
up the beds, leaving great wrinkles and bumps,
which proved to be top sheets and blankets that
she had not thought fit to pull up. When Helen
remonstrated and made her take all the covers
off to air before making the beds she obeyed, but
put the covers back on regardless of sequence,
with counterpanes next to the mattress and
sheets on top, with blankets anywhere that her
fancy dictated. She swept the dirt safely under
the rugs; wiped up the floor with bath towels;
and the crowning glory of her achievement was
sticking all the tooth-brushes together.</p>

<p>Now when we remember that Helen herself
had perhaps never made up a bed in her whole
life until about eight months before this time,
we may indeed have sympathy for her in her
tribulations. Her days were full to running
over, beginning very early in the morning and
ending only after the family was fed at night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
The cooking was not so difficult, as she had a
genius for it and consequently a liking. Chloe
could wash dishes after a fashion and clean the
kitchen utensils, which was some comfort.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter always carried his wife&rsquo;s breakfast
tray to her room and waited on her like a devoted
slave. He would even have run the ribbons in
had she trusted him. All he could do for her
now was wait on her and spoil her, and this he did
to perfection. She was the same lovely little
creature he had married and he was not unreasonable
enough to expect her to be anything else.
He did not think it strange that his little canary
could not turn herself into a raven and feed him
when he was hungry. His tenderness to his
wife was so great that his daughters took their
keynote from him and their patience towards
their mother was wonderful. They vied with
one another in their attentions to the parent that
they would not let themselves call selfish.</p>

<p>Helen cooked her little dainties; Nan kept her
in light literature from the circulating library in
town; Lucy scoured the fields for mushrooms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
that a late fall had made plentiful; Douglas always
brought her the choice fruit and flowers
that her pupils showered on her; even Bobby did
his part by bringing her ripe persimmons that
the frost had nipped just enough to make delicious.
Mr. Carter was often able to bring her
in a partridge or a young hare. On the whole
life wasn&rsquo;t so bad. When one felt perfectly
well, semi-invalidism was a pretty pleasant state.
As for society: the count was a frequent visitor
and the ladies from Grantly most attentive.
The Suttons had called, too, several times, and
other county families were finding the Carters
out. It was easy to treat the fact that they were
living in the overseer&rsquo;s house as a kind of joke.
Of course, anyone could tell that they were not
the kind of persons who usually lived in overseers&rsquo;
houses.</p>

<p>Chloe was the thorn in the flesh, the fly in the
ointment for Mrs. Carter. Chloe could not be
laughed away,&mdash;Chloe was no joke. Accustomed
to trained, highly-paid servants to do
her bidding, this rough, uncouth ourang-outang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
was more than the dainty little lady could
stand.</p>

<p>The very first time Count de Lestis called,
Mrs. Carter happened to be alone in the house
except for Chloe, Mr. Carter having gone to
Preston for much-needed nails and Helen having
run up to Grantly to ask the advice of Miss
Ella on the best way to preserve some late pears.
A knock and Chloe promptly fell down the steps
in her eagerness to get to the door. She had
been up in Douglas&rsquo;s and Helen&rsquo;s room attempting
to make up the bed to suit Miss Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank Gawd I fell down instidder up! If&rsquo;n
I had &rsquo;a&rsquo; fell up I wouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; got ma&rsquo;ied dis
year,&rdquo; and she picked herself up and dived at the
front door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are Mr. and Mrs. Carter and the young
ladies at home?&rdquo; Mrs. Carter heard in the
count&rsquo;s fine baritone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nawsir! The boss is done gone ter Preston
ter fetch some nails ter try ter bolster up this
here ole shack, an&rsquo; Miss Douglas is done gone ter
her teachin&rsquo; job an&rsquo; Miss Helen is done stepped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
up to see Miss Ellanlouise &rsquo;bout &rsquo;zervin&rsquo; some ole
hard pears&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how about Mrs. Carter?&rdquo; in an amused
voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, she is a-layin&rsquo; on the sofy tryin&rsquo; ter git
sick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is she ill?&rdquo; solicitously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naw! She is jes&rsquo; plum lazy. She&rsquo;s too lazy
ter chaw an&rsquo; has ter have all her victuals fixed
soft like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, will you please take her this card?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That there ticket?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Imagine Mrs. Carter&rsquo;s mortification, when the
grinning Chloe came running into the sitting-room
with the count&rsquo;s card crushed in her eager
hand, to discover that the wretched girl was in
her stocking feet; capless, with her wrapped
plaits sticking out all over her head like quills
upon the fretful porcupine; her apron on hind
part before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chloe! Where is your cap?&rdquo; exclaimed that
elegant lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, lawsamussy! I done forgot about it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
It do make my haid eatch so I done pulled it
off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And your shoes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;s savin&rsquo; them fer big meetin&rsquo; nex&rsquo; year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why do you wear your apron in the
back? Put it on right this minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Ole Miss, my dress was siled an&rsquo; my
ap&rsquo;on was clean, so I jes&rsquo; slid it &rsquo;roun&rsquo; behinst so
it wouldn&rsquo;t git siled, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nothing but the fact that the count was cooling
his heels on the front porch kept Mrs. Carter
from weeping outright. Old Miss, indeed! All
she could do was feebly tell Chloe to ask the gentleman
in.</p>

<p>If Count de Lestis had been ushered in by a
butler in livery he could not have entered in a
more ceremonious manner. He bowed low over
the fair lady&rsquo;s hand, kissing her finger-tips
lightly. Even the spectacle of Chloe&rsquo;s walking
off, with her clean apron on hind part before and
her shoeless condition disclosing large holes in
the heels of her stockings, did not upset his gravity.
He, too, realized that Chloe was no joke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Afterwards Chloe said to Helen:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That sho&rsquo; is a pretty man what comed ter see
you alls. I ain&rsquo;t knowin&rsquo; yit what made him
stoop over an&rsquo; smell yo&rsquo; ma&rsquo;s hand. Cose she
mus&rsquo; smell pow&rsquo;ful good with never put&rsquo;n her
hands in nothin&rsquo; mo&rsquo; than her own victuals.&rdquo;
Helen was weak with laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What fer they call him a count, Miss Helen?
Is it &rsquo;cause he spen&rsquo; all his time a-countin&rsquo; out
money? They do say he is pow&rsquo;ful good an&rsquo; kin&rsquo;
ter the niggers. Some say he likes niggers better&rsquo;n
what he does white folks, but I says that is
plum foolish. Anyhow, he talks mighty sweet
to &rsquo;em an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t never call &rsquo;em low down triflin&rsquo;
black rascals whin they gits kinder lop-sided
with liquor, like some of the county gents does
whin hands gits so fur gone they can&rsquo;t git in the
craps. He done started a night school over at
Weston what his secondary is teachin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know he had a secretary,&rdquo; exclaimed
Helen, &ldquo;but it certainly is kind of him to try and
help the poor colored people. I wish you could
go to night school, Chloe.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Lawd, Gawd, no! Miss Helen! I ain&rsquo;t got
no call to larn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you read at all, Chloe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I kin read whin they is picters ter go
by. I done been ter school mos&rsquo; six months
countin&rsquo; the diffunt years what I started, but my
ma, she say my haid was too hard an&rsquo; she &rsquo;fraid
it might git cracked open if&rsquo;n teacher tried to put
any mo&rsquo; in it. She say some folks is got sof&rsquo;
haids what kin stretch an&rsquo; they ain&rsquo;t so ap&rsquo; ter
bus&rsquo; open, haids kinder like hog bladders what
you kin keep on a-blowin&rsquo; up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like me to teach you to read,
Chloe?&rdquo; asked Helen, feeling rather ashamed
that this foreigner should come to Virginia and
take more interest in the education of the negroes
than she should ever have done. &ldquo;I believe
I could teach you without breaking your
head open.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything you says do I&rsquo;ll do, but I tell you
now I ain&rsquo;t got no mo&rsquo; notion er readin&rsquo; than a
tarrapin. A tarrapin kin git his haid out&rsquo;n the
shell an&rsquo; you might git a little larnin&rsquo; in it, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
my haid is groun&rsquo; what you gotter break up with
a grubbin&rsquo; hoe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am willing to try. Let&rsquo;s begin now! First
we will learn how to spell things right here in the
kitchen and then you can soon be reading recipes,&rdquo;
said Helen kindly. &ldquo;Now we are making
biscuit, so we will begin with that. First
take two cups of flour,&rdquo; and she wrote on the
whitewashed wall of the kitchen: &ldquo;2 cups of
flour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chloe was delighted with this kind of school,
very different from her former experiences
where she was made to sit for hours on a hard
bench saying the same thing over and over with
no conception of what it was all about. Now
&ldquo;2 cups of flour&rdquo; had some sense in it, so had
&ldquo;2 spoons of baking powder.&rdquo; &ldquo;Lard the size
of an egg&rdquo; was a brilliant remark; &ldquo;1 spoon of
salt&rdquo; had a gleam of intelligence, too; &ldquo;1 cup of
milk&rdquo; was filled with gumption. In less than a
week the girl could read and write the recipe for
biscuit and was eagerly waiting for her beloved
Miss Helen to advance her to cake.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

<span class="f8">BOBBY&rsquo;S BLAME DAY</span></h2>


<p>Dr. George Wright was making a name for
himself in his chosen profession. Older men
were beginning to look upon him as an authority
on nervous cases and now he had been asked to
come in as partner in a sanitarium starting in the
capital city of Virginia. Certainly he had been
very successful in his treatment of Robert Carter&rsquo;s
case, so successful that even Mrs. Carter
could not but admire him. She was still very
much in awe of him, but he had her respect and
she depended upon him. The daughters felt the
same way without the awe. Douglas and Nan
and Lucy were openly extravagant in their
praise of him. Helen was a little more guarded
in her expressions of admiration, but she had a
sincere liking for him and deep gratitude not
only for what he had done for her father but for
his service to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>She could never forget that it was Dr. Wright
who had brought her to her senses when her
father was first taken ill, making her see herself
as a selfish, extravagant, vain girl. It takes
some generosity of spirit to like the person who
makes you see the error of your ways, but Helen
Carter had that generosity. There were times
when her cheeks burned at the memory of what
Dr. Wright must have thought of her. How
silly he must have found her, how childish!</p>

<p>After the experience in the mountains when
the rattlesnake bit her on the heel and Dr.
Wright had come to her assistance with first aid
to the injured, which in the case of a snake bite
means sucking the wound, Helen began to realize
that what the young physician thought of her
made a great deal of difference to her. His approval
was something worth gaining.</p>

<p>Douglas had not told her she had written the
letter to Dr. Wright as Bobby&rsquo;s employer. She
had a feeling that her dignity as teacher was involved
and she must not confide in her family.
She was waiting, hoping to hear from him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
rather expecting him to write to Bobby and call
him to account for his misdemeanors.</p>

<p>Bobby had been especially unruly all week.
There was nothing he had not thought of doing
in the way of mischief, and thinking mischief
was almost identical with doing mischief where
Bobby Carter was concerned. The deed was no
sooner conceived than accomplished and the
other children, who were inclined to be naughty,
thought up extra things for him to do.</p>

<p>Putting a piece of rubber on the stove was certainly
not Bobby&rsquo;s idea, nor slipping chestnut
burrs in the desk-seats while the girls were not
looking, causing howls of anguish when they inadvertently
sat down on the same. Bobby manfully
took the blame for all of these things,
however, confidently certain that no punishment
worth speaking of would be meted out to
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is honest, at least,&rdquo; sighed Douglas,
&ldquo;and owns up every time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Friday afternoon on the way home she felt
that maybe Nan&rsquo;s name for their place was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
good one. She was almost a dead warrior if not
quite one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, for a Valkyrie to bear me to Valhalla!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bobby was trudging along by her side looking
as though butter would not melt in his mouth.
What a sturdy little fellow he was growing to
be! Douglas looked down on his jaunty, erect
figure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bobby, you are getting right fat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bobby slapped his pockets. &ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t fat,
that&rsquo;s blame pay!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blame pay! What on earth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, them is the gif&rsquo;s I gits fer saying I done
it ev&rsquo;y time you asks us to hol&rsquo; up our han&rsquo;s who
done it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bobby!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, the big fellers say you ain&rsquo;t man
enough to whup &rsquo;em an&rsquo; you is too soft to whup
me, so I don&rsquo;t run no risk nohow. This is a top
string I got for &rsquo;tendin&rsquo; like I put the rubber on
the stove,&mdash;this here is a big apple I got for not
fillin&rsquo; the girls&rsquo; desks with chestnut burrs,&mdash;this
here pile er oak balls I come mighty near not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
gettin&rsquo;. I sho&rsquo; did want to turn the fleas loose
on Minnie Brice but the big boys was afraid I
might not be able to open the little purse right
and so one of them done it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fleas on Minnie Brice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you never did fin&rsquo; out about it, so I
didn&rsquo;t have to own up. You know what a funny
thin neck Minnie&rsquo;s got, just like a mud turkle,
and how she wears a stiff collar kinder like a
shell and it sets out all around, fur out from her
neck?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; said Douglas, struggling
with a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, the fellers caught some fleas off&rsquo;n ol&rsquo;
Blitz&rsquo;s houn&rsquo; dog an&rsquo; then they put &rsquo;em in a
teensy money purse with a tight clasp, an&rsquo; while
Minnie was leaning over studying her joggerfy,
Tim Tenser dumped &rsquo;em all down her back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Minnie! No wonder she missed all of
her lessons today. I could not imagine what
was the matter with her. Bobby, you wouldn&rsquo;t
have done such a cruel thing as that surely!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shoo! That ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo;. It might &rsquo;a&rsquo; been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
toads, &rsquo;cep&rsquo;n the little ones is all growed up big
now. We are a-savin&rsquo; up the toad joke &rsquo;til
spring. First the fellers said I didn&rsquo;t &rsquo;serve no
blame money &rsquo;cause Minnie jes&rsquo; cried when she
missed her lessons an&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t scratch none, only
wiggled, an&rsquo; teacher never did ask us to hol&rsquo; up
our han&rsquo;s who done it. But Ned Beatty said I
was a dead game spo&rsquo;t an&rsquo; I took the chanst an&rsquo;
I mus&rsquo; have my blood money, an&rsquo; so I got all
these here oak balls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bobby, do you realize that you must take all
of these blame gifts back to the boys?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blamed if I will!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t talk that way! Don&rsquo;t say:
&lsquo;Blamed if you will.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, wasn&rsquo;t you a-talkin&rsquo; that way? Didn&rsquo;t
you say, &lsquo;blame gif&rsquo;s,&rsquo; with your own mouth?
I&rsquo;d like to know why I have to take them
back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you got them for taking the blame and
now you no longer take the blame but have told
on the ones who did the naughty things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I ain&rsquo;t a-tellin&rsquo; teacher! I&rsquo;m a-tellin&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
my own sister Douglas. You ain&rsquo;t teacher
&rsquo;cep&rsquo;n when you is in school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, so that is the way you look at it! I suppose
you think I am not your own sister while I
am teacher, either, and when you worry me sick
at school it is only teacher and not Douglas you
are distressing so much,&rdquo; and Douglas sat down
on the roadside and burst out crying.</p>

<p>Now Douglas Carter was no weeper. I doubt
if her little brother had ever seen her shed a tear
in all of his seven years. And he, Robert Carter,
Jr., had done this thing! He had made his
sister Douglas cry. When she was playing
teacher, she had feelings just as much as she did
when she turned into his sister Douglas again.
And what was this thing she was saying about
his having to give back the blood money? Had
he told on the boys after having received pay for
taking the blame? Why, that was a low-down,
sneaky trick!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, Douglas, please don&rsquo;t cry! I&rsquo;m
a-gonter take back all the things&mdash;&rsquo;cep&rsquo;n the
apple&mdash;I done et into that a leetle bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>But the flood gates were opened and Douglas
could not stop crying. Like most persons who
cry with difficulty, when she once began she kept
it up. Now she was crying for all the times she
might have cried. She had had enough to make
her cry but had held in. She was crying now
for all the days and nights of anxiety she had
spent in thinking of her sick father; she was crying
for the stern way in which she had been
forced to deal with her mother over extravagancies;
she was crying for having to make Helen
understand that there was no money for clothes;
she was crying for having to be the adamant sister
who forced Nan and Lucy to go on to school;
she was crying because her own dream of college
was to come to nothing; she was crying very little
because of Bobby&rsquo;s naughtiness, but he, of
course, thought that it was all because of him.</p>

<p>One of her biggest grievances was against
herself: why had she been so priggish with her
cousin, Lewis Somerville? Last August he had
come to her on the eve of his enlistment to go
with the troops to the Mexican border and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
plead so earnestly with her to try to love him
just a little bit and to let him go off engaged to
her, and she had turned him down with absurd
talk of friendship and the like. He had astonished
her when he made love to her, but she knew
perfectly well in her heart of hearts that it would
have astonished her a great deal more if he had
made love to someone else.</p>

<p>No doubt that was what he was doing that
minute: making love to someone else. A young
man who looked like a Greek god was not going
to be turned down by every girl. How good
Lewis had always been to her and how well he
had understood her! He thought she was cold
and unfeeling now, she just knew he did. She
had received no letters from him for weeks, at
least it seemed weeks. Oh well, if he wanted to
make love to other girls, why she wasn&rsquo;t going to
be the one to care!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Douglas, I hear a auto a-comin&rsquo;. If&rsquo;n you
don&rsquo;t stop bawlin&rsquo; folks will see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A car was coming! She could hear its chug
as it climbed the hill half a mile off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Please wet my handkerchief in that little
branch so I can wash my face,&rdquo; she begged
Bobby, while she smoothed her ruffled hair and
wished she had one of Helen&rsquo;s precious dorines
to powder her red nose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yo&rsquo; hankcher is as wet as water already. I
don&rsquo;t see what you want it any wetter for,&rdquo; said
Bobby, who might have quoted: &ldquo;&lsquo;Too much of
water hast thou, my poor Ophelia,&rsquo;&rdquo; had he
known his Hamlet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a-gonter be bad no mo&rsquo;, Douglas,&rdquo;
declared Bobby as he brought the little handkerchief
back from the brook dripping wet. &ldquo;You
mos&rsquo; cried yo&rsquo; face away, didn&rsquo;t you, Dug?&rdquo; and
with that Douglas had to laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Feel better now?&rdquo; he said with quite the big
brother air. &ldquo;That there car is jes&rsquo; roun&rsquo; the
bend. I reckon if you turn yo&rsquo; face away the
folks in it won&rsquo;t know you is been a-bawlin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The car slowed up, then stopped when the
driver recognized Douglas, and Count de Lestis
sprang out to greet her. The signs of the recent
storm were still visible on her pretty face in spite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
of all the water Bobby had brought from the
brook. Douglas tried to hold her head down so
the count could not see her disfigured countenance,
but such floods of weeping could not but
be noticed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Miss Carter, you are in distress!&rdquo;
He looked so truly grieved and anxious that already
Douglas felt somewhat comforted. Sympathy
is a great balm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is nothing! I am a foolish, weak girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not that! You are very intelligent and far
from weak. Are you not the staunch ally? The
poor Kaiser would not find you weak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I done it all! I made her cry!&rdquo; declared
Bobby.</p>

<p>The count looked at the youngster, amused.
&ldquo;And so! Do little American gentlemen make
their sisters cry?&rdquo; Bobby hung his head.
&ldquo;Well, come on and let me take you home, and
then I&rsquo;ll take your sister for a little ride and wipe
all the tears away with the wind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me go riding, too. I don&rsquo;t want to go
home.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not this time. My little red car doesn&rsquo;t
like to take for long rides boys who make their
sisters cry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Bobby had to climb meekly in to be ignominiously
dumped at the yard gate while Douglas
was whisked off in the count&rsquo;s natty little red
roadster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you are looking like your beautiful
self,&rdquo; he declared, slowing down his racer and
turning to gaze into Douglas&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;What is
it that made you weep so profusely? Not the
little brother. Beautiful damsels do not weep
so much because of little brothers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Douglas smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, the sun has come out! Now I am happy.
I am so distressed by tears that I can hardly
bear it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must have a very tender heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, perhaps! Now tell me what caused
your grief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How handsome this man was and how kind!
He seemed like an old friend. He really did
care what was troubling her and it would be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
relief to pour out all of her foolish griefs.
Douglas missed her father&rsquo;s sympathy. She
knew that he was as ready as ever with his love
and solicitude for her, but she felt that she must
not add to his worries one iota. Her mother
was out of the question and Helen was too
young. Before she knew it, she was trying to
tell Count de Lestis all about it, all but about
Lewis Somerville&mdash;somehow that was something
she could not mention. Her grievances
sounded very small when she tried to put them
into words. Naturally she could not dwell upon
her mother&rsquo;s extravagancies or this man would
think her poor little mother was selfish; Helen
was such a trump, the fact that she longed for
stylish clothes certainly was not enough to make
a grown girl sit on the roadside and dissolve in
tears; while Nan and Lucy were commuting to
school like little soldiers. It ended by being a
humorous account of Bobby and his blame pay.</p>

<p>Of course the count knew perfectly well that
that was not all that had made this lovely girl
give way so to grief. No doubt Bobby&rsquo;s misbehavior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
was the last straw, but there had been a
heavy load to carry before Douglas&rsquo;s camel of
endurance had got his back broken. He laughed
merrily over the fleas and Douglas forgot all
about her worries and laughed, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor little Minnie! She did squirm so, and
think of her being too ladylike to scratch, and
how she must have disappointed those bad boys
by refraining!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, if all women would just squirm and not
scratch it would take much from the pleasure of
teasing them,&rdquo; laughed de Lestis. &ldquo;What
amuses me is how boys are alike all the world
over. The discipline of my school days was
very strict, but a thing like that might have happened
among boys in Berlin as much as here in a
rural school in Virginia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Berlin! But you are Hungarian!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So! So&mdash;but Hungarians can go to school
in Berlin. Even Americans have profited by
the educational advantages offered there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Douglas thought her companion&rsquo;s tone
sounded a little harsh. She bent her candid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
gaze on him and met his glowing eyes. Blue
eyes looked unflinchingly into black until the
steering of the red car forced him to give his attention
to the wheel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish the count&rsquo;s moustache did not turn up
quite so much at the corners,&rdquo; thought the girl.
&ldquo;It makes him look a wee bit like the Kaiser; of
course, though, he is kind and the Kaiser is
cruel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we had better turn around now,&rdquo;
she suggested gently, contrite that even for a
moment she had thought this kind friend could
resemble the hated Kaiser.</p>

<p>Certainly the wind had wiped away all traces
of the emotional storm from Douglas&rsquo;s countenance.
The young man by her side could but
admire the pure profile presented to him, with
its soft, girlish lines but withal a look of strength
and determination. Her loosened hair was like
sunlight and her cheeks had the pink of the Cherokee
rose. Profiles were all well enough, but he
would like another look into those eyes as blue as
summer skies after a shower.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, my dear Miss Carter, I know that
the little rascal Bobby must have been very annoying
but I cannot but think that you have not
entrusted to me your real troubles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Douglas stiffened almost imperceptibly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When one finds a beautiful damsel sitting
by the roadside in such grief that her charming
face is convulsed with weeping, one cannot but
divine that some affair of the heart has touched
her. Tell me, has some bold cavalier trifled with
her affections?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Douglas stiffened more perceptibly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your father told me of a young cousin, a
Mr. Somerville, who is now on the Mexican border&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father told you! I don&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear young lady, he only told me there
was such a cousin; you have told me the rest.
Now! Now! Don&rsquo;t let your sweet eyes shed another
tear for him. He is not worth it! If he
can find amusement in the ladies of Mexico, who
are, when all is told, an untidy lot, why should
you worry? There are other fish in the sea!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>If the Count de Lestis wished to see something
more of Douglas&rsquo;s eyes he had his desire
fulfilled now. She turned and once more blue
eyes looked unflinchingly into black. This time
the black eyes had a mischievous gleam and the
blue ones looked more like winter ice than summer
skies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I have made you angry.&rdquo; Once more
his car took his attention for the moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all!&rdquo; icily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wish you had not come with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I appreciate your kindness in bringing me
for the drive very much,&rdquo; still cold and formal
in tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guessed too well, that is where I sinned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Douglas was silent, but she still looked at her
companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is like the little Minnie: she squirms but
will not scratch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was just thinking,&rdquo; said Douglas, changing
the subject with a swiftness that disarmed
the count, &ldquo;your moustache certainly turns up
at the ends just like Emperor William&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="l1" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<span class="f8">SATURDAY</span></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it glorious to be living and for it to be
Saturday?&rdquo; yawned Lucy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and not to have to catch that old train,&rdquo;
and Nan snuggled down luxuriously under the
bedclothes. &ldquo;I used to think Saturday was a
pretty good institution when we lived in town,
but now&mdash;Oh, ye gods! Now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you know that Saturday was decreed a
half-holiday in the days of the Saxon King Edgar
958 <span class="lower">A.&nbsp;D.</span>?&rdquo; asked Lucy, who had a way of
springing historical facts on people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but I know it&rsquo;s going to be a whole holiday
for Nan Carter in the year of grace 1916. I
intend to do nothing but laze the whole day long,
laze and read.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I bet you won&rsquo;t. I bet you go nutting with
Mag and me, because if we go it means Billy
goes along, and if he goes along he&rsquo;ll be in a
terrible grouch unless you go, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>October had delightfully spread over into November.
The weather had obligingly stayed
good, and although our Carters had been at Valhalla
more than a month, they had experienced
no real bad days.</p>

<p>Nippy, frosty nights had put Mr. Carter wise
to the many cracks that he must stop up.
Weather strips must be put on windows and
doors, panes of glass must be puttied in. Suspicious
stains on walls and ceilings warned him
of leaks, but he had to wait for a rain to locate
them. He found himself almost as busy as he
had been before his breakdown, but busy in such
a different way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s Saturday! I think I won&rsquo;t
work today,&rdquo; he had remarked to his wife at
about the same time Nan and Lucy were having
their talk. &ldquo;Come and walk in the woods with
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That lady had graciously consented, if he
promised not to go far and to lift her over
fences.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll wash my hair today; and darn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the stockings; and go over the accounts; and
write some letters; and read the <cite>Saturday Evening
Post</cite>,&rdquo; said Douglas as she and Helen
dressed hurriedly. Their little attic room was
hot in summer and cold in winter.</p>

<p>Douglas had been thinking a great deal about
her ride with the count. Had he only meant to
tease her? Was he trying to flirt with her?
Did she like him at all or did she in a way distrust
him? She asked herself all of these questions.
Of course she liked him! Why should
she distrust a man because of the way his moustache
grew? Of course he was teasing her, and
who could help teasing a silly goose of a girl who
sat on the roadside and bawled until her nose was
disgracefully red, and then insisted it was all because
her little brother had aided and abetted in
the crime of putting fleas down a little girl&rsquo;s
neck? He had made a good guess about Lewis
Somerville, because no doubt her father had told
him that she and Lewis had been chums from the
time they were babies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only hope I will be able to make up to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
for my discourtesy by being very polite to him
the next time I see him,&rdquo; she thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Count de Lestis is coming to lunch with us
today,&rdquo; said Helen, almost as though she had
been reading her sister&rsquo;s mind. &ldquo;Father asked
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good! Isn&rsquo;t it nice for Father to
have such a congenial friend?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Mumsy! She enjoys his visits so much.
I am going to try and have a scrumptious luncheon,
but I tell you I am going to leave mighty
little of it to Chloe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think she is improving, Helen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course she is improving. She is trying
so hard to do what I want her to and I am trying
so hard to be patient. I think I am improving
some myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, honey, you are simply splendid. I
think you have the hardest job of all and I think
you are doing better than any of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; But Helen looked very happy
over her sister&rsquo;s praise. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather do general
housework for six dollars a month than go every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
day and teach thirty little nincompoops a-b,
ab.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the thing is you are doing general
housework for nothing a month.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am doing a little teaching of a-b, ab, too,
only my methods are different. I have evolved
a very advanced style of teaching and Chloe, too,
is learning to spell. My method is somewhat
that of Dotheboys&rsquo; Hall&mdash;you remember:
&lsquo;W-i-n-d-o-w, window&mdash;Go wash them.&rsquo; I
make her spell and write all the kitchen utensils.
She learns while she is working and it makes her
take an interest in becoming educated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Helen, you are so clever! You must let
me help about the luncheon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How about washing your head; and writing
your letters; and casting up the household accounts;
and the <cite>Saturday Evening Post</cite>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, the letters and <cite>Post</cite> will keep!&rdquo;</p>

<p>On Saturday the rule was that the dead warriors
must make up their own beds and clean
their own rooms, so shortly after breakfast there
was a general scramble in process. Helen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
turned Chloe loose in the dining-room to have it
swept and garnished for their distinguished visitor.</p>

<p>What a pretty room it was, much the most attractive
in the house, with the exception of the
sitting-room, perhaps! Low, rough-hewn rafters
were frankly exposed to view. The walls
were sealed with pine boards. Walls and ceiling
were both painted a very soft, pleasing grey-green.
On the high mantel was an old-fashioned
wooden clock with painted door, and this was
flanked on both sides by funny old vases with
large raised roses and gilt ears. Two high windows
and a glass door, opening on a covered
passage leading to the kitchen, gave a soft and
insufficient light.</p>

<p>Douglas had just put the finishing touch to
the table: a bunch of cosmos sent down by the
Misses Grant. Nan had made the mayonnaise;
and Lucy had found a great basket of mushrooms
and peeled them for Helen to cream.
Truly they were to have a scrumptious luncheon.
The count had arrived and was playing lady-come-to-see,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
so Lucy said, with Mrs. Carter.</p>

<p>The whir of a motor drew the attention of all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who on earth!&rdquo; exclaimed Helen. &ldquo;Surely
not callers at this hour, just when my popovers
are almost ready to eat!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mo&rsquo; comply!&rdquo; declared Chloe. &ldquo;Dat ol&rsquo;
red rooster what yo&rsquo; paw set so much sto&rsquo; by is
been a-crowing halleluja all mornin&rsquo;. I been
a-tryin&rsquo; ter make him hesh, &rsquo;cause we ain&rsquo;t got no
mo&rsquo; cheers fer comply.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, there aren&rsquo;t but eight dining-room
chairs,&rdquo; laughed Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My &rsquo;ployer done come and a soger is in with
him!&rdquo; cried Bobby, tearing excitedly by the dining-room
in his race to open the gate for his beloved
Dr. Wright.</p>

<p>Helen ran out in her pink bungalow apron,
first peeping into the oven, not trusting Chloe
yet to keep things from burning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Douglas!&rdquo; she called excitedly, but Douglas,
with flushed cheeks, bent over the bowl of
cosmos.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;A soldier with him! What soldier? Could
it be Lewis?&rdquo; she asked herself.</p>

<p>It was Lewis Somerville, looking very handsome
and upstanding indeed in his khaki uniform,
with his face burned a deep bronze so that
his eyes looked very blue and his teeth very
white. He clambered out over the great
basket of fruit Dr. Wright was bringing to Mrs.
Carter, dropped the boxes and parcels piled in
around him and hugged and kissed all the female
cousins in sight, Helen, Nan and Lucy. He
shook Bobby by the hand, knowing full well that
that youngster would sooner die than be hugged
and kissed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Douglas, where is Douglas?&rdquo; he whispered
to Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the dining-room! You can get there
around at the back of the house&mdash;in the basement.
We thought you were still in Mexico.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lewis did not wait to tell her that he wasn&rsquo;t,
but doing double quick time he streaked around
the house, and finding the basement stairs without
any trouble, he was down them in one stride.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Douglas!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lewis!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Douglas forgot that not so very many months
before this time she had informed her cousin that
she was too big to be kissed and that he was not
close enough kin to warrant indiscriminate hugging.
Certainly she was no younger than she
had been eight months before and Lewis was no
closer kin, but now she submitted to his embraces
and even clung to him for a moment.</p>

<p>It was so wonderful to have him back safe and
sound. She could hardly believe it was only
yesterday that she had sat on the roadside and
wept. He was her same Lewis, too. She felt
instinctively that the count&rsquo;s suggestion in regard
to Mexican beauties was ridiculous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Lewis, sergeant stripes on your sleeve,
too! Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did! Didn&rsquo;t you get my letter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not for weeks and weeks!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strange! I must say I am not crazy about
that letter&rsquo;s being lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you tell me what was in it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure! I&rsquo;m telling you now,&rdquo; and the young
man caught her to him once more, but Douglas
suddenly remembered she was too old to be
kissed by a second cousin, once removed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not crazy about having anyone but you read that
letter, though, not only because of my telling
you this,&rdquo; and he took another for luck, &ldquo;but,&rdquo;
as Douglas recovered her maidenly reserve and
pushed him from her laughing, &ldquo;I said some
other things in that letter that I wouldn&rsquo;t like
anyone and everyone to see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;State secrets?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, a newly-made sergeant would hardly
have such things intrusted to him! It was only
my opinion concerning the state of affairs down
there on the border. I may be wrong about
things, but a soldier has no right to blab his conclusions
about conditions in belligerent countries,
especially when the press is wary in its comments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t worry a moment about it. If
you could see the road that our R.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;D. has to
come over you would not wonder that some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
our letters jolt out. There is one creek to cross
that is like going down the Grand Canyon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it only jolted out there and found watery
oblivion, I shan&rsquo;t mind. But what a bully little
shack this is! Wright was afraid we would not
get here in time for luncheon, and he and I were
determined to lie and say we had eaten, but gee,
I&rsquo;m glad not to have to perjure my soul!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

<span class="f8">GOLDILOCKS&rsquo; CHAIRS</span></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Miss Hell-e-en! Miss Hell-e-en! Yo&rsquo;
popovers is done popped over!&rdquo; came in a wailing
shriek from the kitchen.</p>

<p>Helen went so fast her pink bungalow apron
looked like a rosy streak. Dr. Wright, fearing
some dire calamity had befallen someone and his
&ldquo;first aid to the injured&rdquo; might be in demand,
ran after her. <a href="#frontis">The popovers had popped just
right</a>, however, but must be devoured immediately;
so luncheon was served as quickly as
possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring those two chairs from the kitchen,
Chloe,&rdquo; commanded Douglas as she deftly rearranged
the table for ten persons instead of eight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Miss Douglas, don&rsquo;t you know &rsquo;bout
dem cheers in de kitchen? Th&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t got no mo&rsquo;
seat to &rsquo;em dan a rabbit.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring them anyhow,&rdquo; laughed Douglas. &ldquo;I
can sit in one and Miss Helen in the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the confusion of placing family and guests,
Douglas forgot all about the bottomless chairs.
After everyone was seated she suddenly remembered
them with horror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose the count got one of them!&rdquo; It
made very little difference about anyone else.
But the count! All of that charm and elegance
in a chair with no seat!</p>

<p>As soon as grace was said, Bobby, with a
shriek of delight, suddenly collapsed and disappeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One chair accounted for!&rdquo; thought Douglas.</p>

<p>Bobby&rsquo;s heels were sticking up and he peered
saucily through his feet at the astonished company.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I done got a Goldilocks&rsquo; cheer,&rdquo; he announced.
&ldquo;&lsquo;An&rsquo; Goldilocks sat, an&rsquo; sat, an&rsquo;
sat, an&rsquo; sat &rsquo;til she sat the bottom out of the little
bar&rsquo;s cheer.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bobby, take your seat!&rdquo; commanded Mr.
Carter, trying to look stern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I done took it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Easier said than done! Bobby was fast stuck,
&ldquo;I reckon my &rsquo;ployer&rsquo;ll have to op&rsquo;rate on
me,&rdquo; he said plaintively, &ldquo;&rsquo;fo&rsquo; I kin eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a roar of laughter at this and Dr.
Wright, who was sitting between Helen and
Bobby, extricated the youngster and then
changed chairs with him, whereupon they proceeded
to the business of eating popovers and
creamed mushrooms and the other good things
that Helen had planned for the repast.</p>

<p>Douglas then laughingly told of their predicament
in having only eight whole straight chairs
in the house and of her intention of sitting on one
of the decrepit ones herself and of having Helen
sit on the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is rather like playing &lsquo;Thimble, thimble!
Who&rsquo;s got the thimble?&rsquo;&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;I
hope whoever has it is comfortable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t all speak at once!&rdquo; said Lucy. &ldquo;Of
course some of the company&rsquo;s got it, because
home folks would put you out of misery at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>Still silence and Douglas was mortally certain
the count had it and was too polite to say so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He certainly has beautiful manners,&rdquo; she
said to herself, and turning from Lewis, who was
endeavoring to monopolize her, she smiled her
sweetest on the courteous foreigner. She felt
she must make up to him anyhow for telling him
his moustache turned up like the Kaiser&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it strange, Cousin Robert,&rdquo; said Lewis
to Mr. Carter, &ldquo;I wrote Douglas I was coming
and she never got my letter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The count&rsquo;s manner was a little distrait.
Evidently he was trying to hear what Douglas
was saying and to listen to the conversation between
Lewis and Mr. Carter at the same time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that so? I am afraid our postman is
careless. He seems to get the mail mixed sometimes.
Every now and then our letters get left
at Grantly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the ladies up there would send them
down, I am sure,&rdquo; said Mrs. Carter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You got my telephone message all right,
didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Dr. Wright asked Douglas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What message?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I telephoned Grantly I would be out
today!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, they did not deliver it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they will send the letter with the
message,&rdquo; suggested the count in an amused
tone.</p>

<p>Just then Chloe fell down the steps into the
dining-room with a plate of hot popovers, which
she adroitly caught before they reached the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Ellanlouise done sent Sis Tempy down
with the news that you alls is gonter hab some
comply. They done dis&rsquo;greed whether they is
a-comin&rsquo; yesterday or tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is it coming?&rdquo; laughed Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They done &rsquo;sputed whether it is a doctor or a
lywer, an&rsquo; they ain&rsquo;t able t&rsquo; agree what his name
is, but Miss Ella thinks it is Stites an&rsquo; Miss
Louise she holds that it is Bright. Both on &rsquo;em
was a-tryin&rsquo; ter listen at the &rsquo;phome ter onct so
they done got kinder twis&rsquo;ed like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When was the message sent?&rdquo; asked Douglas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Sis Tempy said Miss Ella said it come of a
Chuseday an&rsquo; Miss Louise called her back an&rsquo;
tol&rsquo; her not ter pay no &rsquo;tention ter Miss Ella,
that she knows it come of a Thursday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, that must be my message I sent on
Wednesday!&rdquo; exclaimed Dr. Wright. &ldquo;I am
either Lawyer Stites or Dr. Bright.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; and everyone laughed heartily
over the mistake of the peculiar old sisters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it doesn&rsquo;t make any real difference
since you are here, does it?&rdquo; asked Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit! Being here is what is important
to me. Does it make any difference to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Wright was able to say this in a whisper to
Helen. It seemed very difficult for him to have
many words in private with this girl, who seemed
to him to become more charming every day.
Certainly adversity had improved her in his eyes.
The character and determination she had shown
when once the gravity of her father&rsquo;s condition
had been explained to her were really remarkable
in one so young, and one who had up to
that time never done a single thing she had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
wanted to do. Tête-à-têtes with Helen were
made difficult for him by reason of his popularity
with the whole Carter family. Mr. Carter had
various questions to discuss with him; Mrs. Carter
must always tell him her symptoms; Douglas
wanted his advice about many things; Nan
found him very sympathetic and always had
something to confide in him; Lucy, realizing that
Helen no longer looked upon him as an enemy
to the family, had come over to his camp and
now considered him her company just as much
as anybody&rsquo;s and demanded his attention accordingly.
Of course Bobby knew he belonged exclusively
to him. Was he not his &rsquo;ployer?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does it make any difference to you?&rdquo; he repeated.</p>

<p>Helen was on the point of answering him very
kindly when Count de Lestis leaned over and
engaged her attention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Helen, do not forget the promise you
made me to come to Weston some morning with
your father. There are many things I want to
show you. I want your advice, too, about some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
pantry arrangements I am contemplating.
What does mere man know of pantry shelves?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d love to come!&rdquo; exclaimed Helen,
and the kind answer she was preparing to give
Dr. Wright never was spoken.</p>

<p>That young physician looked at the Hungarian
count as though he would cheerfully throttle
him. Helen&rsquo;s advice about pantry shelves, indeed!
What business had this foreigner to draw
Helen into his household arrangements?</p>

<p>During that luncheon de Lestis managed to
antagonize both Lewis Somerville and George
Wright. Douglas had smiled entirely too many
times on this stranger to suit Lewis, and Helen
had been much too eager to pass on the housekeeping
arrangements to accord with George&rsquo;s
ideas of United States&rsquo; relations with Hungary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why is he not fighting with his country?&rdquo;
each young man asked himself.</p>

<p>Chloe was waiting on the table remarkably
well, much to Helen&rsquo;s gratification. Only once
had she fallen down the steps, and, thanks to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
teacher&rsquo;s vigilance, she usually remembered to
pass things to the left.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must try to show the Count de Lestis
how much you have learned,&rdquo; Helen had told her
while she was preparing the lunch; &ldquo;remember
how interested he is in educating colored people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen, seated at the head of the table, was
pouring the tea, Mrs. Carter having resigned
her place to her daughter when she resigned herself
to be a semi-invalid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hand this to Count de Lestis,&rdquo; Helen said,
having put in sugar to his taste.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s yo&rsquo; C-U-P, CUP of T-E, TEA,&rdquo;
shouted Chloe, as she balanced the cup precariously
on the tray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beg pardon!&rdquo; exclaimed the honored guest
in amazement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;C-U-P, CUP! H-O-T, HOT! T-E,
TEA!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The count took the tea with a puzzled look on
his handsome countenance and Chloe fled from
the room, not in embarrassment but to impart to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Sis Tempy how she had done made Miss Helen
proud by showing the count how much she done
learned her to spell.</p>

<p>Everybody roared, even Mrs. Carter, who had
come to the realization that the most dignified
way to treat Chloe was to recognize her as a joke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is this way,&rdquo; said Helen when she could
speak. &ldquo;You see, I have been trying to teach
the poor thing to read and spell. She told me of
the wonderful work you are doing,&rdquo; to the count.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, in your night school at Weston! It
made me ashamed to think you, a foreigner,
should be doing so much for the colored race,
and I doing nothing, so I determined to do what
I could with my own servant at least. I can&rsquo;t
tell you how splendid I think it is of you and
your secretary to give so much time to the poor
country darkies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The count flushed a dark red. He seemed actually
confused by this girl&rsquo;s praise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All of us think it is fine,&rdquo; said Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speak for yourself!&rdquo; whispered Lucy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
&ldquo;Mag and I think it is smart Alec of him and
we bet he does it &rsquo;cause he wants to, not to help
the colored people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon! Did you speak to me?&rdquo;
asked the count, recovering himself from the
evident confusion into which Helen&rsquo;s and
Nan&rsquo;s approbration seemed to have plunged
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;said&mdash;er&mdash;I said you and your kind
secretary must enjoy the work,&rdquo; stammered
Lucy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you find they learn easily?&rdquo; asked Dr.
Wright, trying to hide his feelings and wishing
he had put in his spare time in altruistic work
among the colored brethren.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The truth of the matter is I do no teaching
myself. This night school is a fad of Herz, my
secretary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, but I know you do some, because
Chloe tells me of how kindly you speak to the
darkies,&rdquo; insisted Helen. &ldquo;She says you make
beautiful talks to them sometimes and they are
crazy about you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;They exaggerate!&rdquo; shrugged the count.
&ldquo;They seem a simple, kindly folk, grateful for
any crumb of learning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t there any district schools here for
the colored people?&rdquo; asked George Wright.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but no place for the older ones to
learn. It is quite pathetic how they yearn for
knowledge,&mdash;so Herz tells me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my opinion is that too much learning
is bad for them,&rdquo; blurted out Lewis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lewis!&rdquo; exclaimed Douglas. &ldquo;How
can you say such a thing? Too much learning
can&rsquo;t be bad for anybody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I mean is too much and not enough.
They get just enough to make them big-headed
and not enough to give them any balance.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&ldquo;&lsquo;A little learning is a dangerous thing&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drink deep or taste not the Pierian Spring,&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>murmured Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; said Lewis gratefully. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want to hold the darky down, but I do think he
should be taught very carefully or he will get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
wrong notions in his head, social equality with
the whites and such stuff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I find Americans very strange when one gets
them on the subject of social equality,&rdquo; and de
Lestis suddenly seemed very superior and quite
conscious of his own station in life. &ldquo;There is
much talk of being democratic but not so much
practice. Your Declaration of Independence
plainly states that all men shall be free and
equal, and still, while you grant the black race
freedom, you deny it equality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon you don&rsquo;t understand the South
very well,&rdquo; answered Lewis, his blue eyes flashing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; was all the count said, but he said it
with a toploftical manner that irritated Lewis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The colored soldiers are excellent, so I have
heard,&rdquo; put in Douglas, hoping to get the subject
changed, if not too abruptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, they are good,&rdquo; said Lewis, &ldquo;but that
is because they are trained well. That is drinking
deep of Nan&rsquo;s Pierian Spring. I think a
military training in colored schools is almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
more important than in the white ones. It gives
them the kind of balance they don&rsquo;t get in any
other way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you give the pupils in your night
school some drilling?&rdquo; asked Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you for the suggestion!&rdquo; and the
count bowed low over Helen&rsquo;s hand as they
arose from the table at a signal from Mrs. Carter,
who began to think the conversation was
getting entirely too serious and not at all social.
&ldquo;I shall profit by it immediately and introduce a
kind of setting-up exercise at least.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll find out who had the other busted
cheer!&rdquo; cried Bobby.</p>

<p>It was the count, and his tact and good manners
in patiently sitting through the meal on
what must have been a rather uncomfortable
perch made the females of the party, excepting
Lucy, admire him just that much more, but it
did not make George Wright and Lewis Somerville
think any more highly of the good-looking
foreigner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He had much better be fighting for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
country,&rdquo; grumbled Lewis to his companion in
misery, &ldquo;even if it would be on the wrong side.&rdquo;
Which was not the proper remark for a soldier
in the army of a neutral nation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

<span class="f8">NOVEMBER</span></h2>


<p>The mystery that will never be solved for the
human race is why some days must be dark and
dreary and why those days sometimes stretch
themselves into weeks.</p>

<p>The weather that had been so perfect when
our Carters first came to Valhalla had held for
a long time. Frosty, crisp autumn mornings
that made the blood tingle in one&rsquo;s veins, followed
by warmer days and then cold bracing
nights when a fire in the great chimney of the
living-room was most acceptable, had become so
much the rule that when the exception occurred
no one was prepared to accept it.</p>

<p>Morning after morning Nan and Lucy had
trudged cheerfully over the fields and through
the lane to Grantly Station to catch the early
train, enjoying the walk and not minding at all
that the quarter of a mile was really three-quarters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Coming home was happy, too. The train
reached Grantly by half-past three, the pleasantest
time in an autumn afternoon, and the
girls would loiter along the road, stopping to eat
wild grapes or to crack walnuts or maybe to get
some persimmons, delicious and shriveled from
the hard frosts. Sometimes Billy and Mag
would have the good news for them that the Suttons&rsquo;
car was to be at Preston and that meant
that our girls were to get out at that station and
be run home by Billy.</p>

<p>They were great favorites with both Mr. and
Mrs. Sutton who encouraged the intimacy with
their son and daughter. Suitable companions
are not always to be found in rural communities
and the coming of the Carters to the neighborhood
was recognized by that worthy couple as
a great advantage to their children.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nan is a charming girl, William,&rdquo; Mrs.
Sutton had said to her husband, &ldquo;and even if
Billy fancies himself to be in love with her it will
do him no harm, only good, since she has such
good sense and breeding.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course it will do him good and maybe it
is not just fancy on his part. We Suttons have
a way of deciding early and sticking to it. Eh,
Margaret? I remember you had your hair in a
plait and wore quite short skirts when I began to
scheme how best to get a permanent seat by you
on the train, and here I&rsquo;ve got it!&rdquo; and Mr. Sutton
gave his portly wife a comfortable hug.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Mag is having a splendid time with
Lucy,&rdquo; continued that lady, accepting the hug
with a smile. &ldquo;Lucy is so quick and clever, no
one could help liking her. I, for one, am glad
the Carters have come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think is the matter with their
mother? They always speak of her as an invalid.
She looks well enough to me, although of course
not robust like one beautiful lady I know.&rdquo; Mr.
Sutton admired his wife so much that the flesh
she was taking on just made her that much more
beautiful in his eyes. He thought there could
not be too much of a good thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Invalid indeed! She is just spoiled and
lazy,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Sutton who was all energy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
and industry. &ldquo;She is attractive enough but I
should hate to be her daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I&rsquo;d hate to be her husband,
too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Suttons had been most pleasant and hospitable
to their new neighbors, although there
could not have been two women brought together
so dissimilar as Mrs. Sutton and Mrs.
Carter. Mrs. Carter considered her mission in
life to be as beautiful as possible and also charming.
Mrs. Sutton had never had time to think
what her mission in life was, she was so busy doing
the things it seemed important to do. She
was first of all the wife of a successful farmer
and that meant eternal vigilance on her part, as
the success of a farm depends so much on the
management of women. Next she was the
mother of two healthy, normal children who
must be trained in the way they should go.
After that she was an important member of a
community where her progressive spirit was
needed and appreciated. Her home, Preston,
was where the Ladies&rsquo; Aid met and worked and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
kept the little church out of debt; there was
headquarters for the Traveling Library; there
the Magazine Club read and swapped periodicals.
She was president of the Preston Equal
Suffrage League, a struggling but valorous
band, and now that work of organizations was
sorely needed for suffering humanity, this same
league was rolling bandages and making comfort
kits for the Allies, showing that votes for
women was not the only thing it could work for.
Truly Mrs. Sutton was a busy and happy
woman.</p>

<p>But we are forgetting that the weather seemed
destined to become our topic! Certainly the
Suttons are a more agreeable subject than the
weather our girls were fated to endure. Of
course the sun can&rsquo;t shine all the time and in the
natural course of events October days must
shorten into November days and they in turn
into December, with nights growing longer and
longer and days shorter and shorter and both of
them colder and colder. Drizzling rains must
fall, even if a trusting family has taken its abode<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
in a weather-beaten old house, up a muddy lane
that must be walked through to reach the station.</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&ldquo;&lsquo;In winter I get up at night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dress by early candle light,&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>yawned Nan one morning as the alarm went off,
warning her it was time to rouse herself and
Lucy. Lucy had curled up in a little ball, having
gone to bed without quite enough cover. It
had turned cold and damp during the night, a
heavy rain had kept up for hours and now at six
in the morning it was drizzling dismally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how we can go to town to-day,&rdquo;
sighed Nan, peering out of the window. &ldquo;It is
so dark and gloomy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon the lane will be awfully muddy,&rdquo;
said Lucy, reluctantly uncurling herself, &ldquo;and I
believe I left my rubbers at school that time I
took them in when I thought it was going to rain
and it didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to borrow Helen&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee! Isn&rsquo;t it cold?&rdquo; and Lucy drew back
the foot she had tentatively poked out of bed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
&ldquo;I wish we could live in a steam-heated house
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Valhalla was heated by open fireplaces, drum
stoves and the Grace of God, according to
Chloe. There was a small stove in the younger
girls&rsquo; room, but up to this time they had not felt
the necessity of having a fire.</p>

<p>It seemed difficult on that rainy morning for
everyone to awaken. Chloe&rsquo;s feet and then her
reluctant legs came through the trap-door of
her attic room and slowly down the chicken steps
leading into the kitchen long after Helen had
started the kerosene stove and put on the kettle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t slep&rsquo; none,&rdquo; she declared when Helen
remonstrated with her because of her tardiness.
&ldquo;The rain done leaked in on my haid an&rsquo; I
reckon I&rsquo;s gonter die er the ammonia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I fancy not! A little water won&rsquo;t hurt
you,&rdquo; said Helen, flying around the kitchen like
a demented hen trying to scratch up a breakfast
for her brood. &ldquo;Hurry up and set the table, it
is so late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t hurt me! Lawsamussy, Miss Helen!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Don&rsquo;t you know that niggers can&rsquo;t wash they
haids in winter time? They do say they wool has
deeper roots than what white folks&rsquo; hair is got
an&rsquo; the water what touches they haids dreens
plum down inter they brains.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brains, did you say?&rdquo; said Helen, but her
sarcasm was lost on Chloe. &ldquo;If it leaked on
your head why didn&rsquo;t you move your bed? It
leaked on Miss Douglas and me, too, but we
moved the bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I was in a kinder stupid an&rsquo; looks like
I couldn&rsquo;t raise han&rsquo; or foot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can well believe it,&rdquo; muttered Helen.
&ldquo;Please set the table as fast as you can!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Helen,&rdquo; cried Lucy, hurrying into the dining-room,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll have to lend me your rubbers!
I left mine in town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, please to!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hate for you to stretch my rubbers all out
of shape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stretch &rsquo;em much! Your feet are bigger
than mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That being the case I certainly won&rsquo;t lend
them to be dropped off in the mud.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Children! Children!&rdquo; admonished Douglas,
hurrying to breakfast. &ldquo;What are you
quarreling about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who shall be Cinderella!&rdquo; drawled Nan.
&ldquo;And it seems a strange subject to dispute
about on such a morning. For my part, I wish
my feet were a quarter of a mile long and I could
take three steps and land at the station.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It leaked in our room last night,&rdquo; said Lucy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And ours!&rdquo; chorused Helen and Douglas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mine, too! But I ain&rsquo;t a-keerin&rsquo;,&rdquo; from
Bobby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My haid is done soaked up with leaks,&rdquo;
grinned Chloe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really think Miss Ella and Miss Louise
should have had the roof mended before we
came,&rdquo; said Douglas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, tonight we can go to bed with our umbrellas
up,&rdquo; suggested Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! An&rsquo; wake up a corp!&rdquo; said Chloe dismally,
as she handed the certainly not overdone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
biscuit. &ldquo;It am sho&rsquo; death ter hist a umbrell in
the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan and Lucy were finally off, forlorn little
figures with raincoats and rubbers and dripping
umbrellas. Helen&rsquo;s rubbers were a bit too
small, much to that young lady&rsquo;s satisfaction and
to Lucy&rsquo;s chagrin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My feet will slim down some as I grow
older, the shoe man told me. I betcher when I
am as old as you are my feet will be smaller,&rdquo;
said Lucy as she paddled off with the rubbers
pulled on as far as she could get them.</p>

<p>The road was passable until they got within a
hundred yards of the station and then they
struck a soft stretch of red clay that was the consistency
of molasses candy about to be pulled.
Nan clambered up an embankment, balancing
herself on a very precarious path that hung over
the road, but Lucy kept to the middle of the
pike.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hear the train!&rdquo; cried Nan. &ldquo;We must
hurry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurry, indeed! How can anyone hurry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
through fudge?&rdquo; and poor Lucy gave a wail of
agony. She was stuck and stuck fast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; begged Nan, but Lucy with an
agonized countenance looked at her sister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m stuck!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I come pull you out, I&rsquo;ll get stuck, too!
What on earth are we to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Throw me a plank,&rdquo; wailed Lucy in the
tones of a drowning man. Her feet were going
in deeper and deeper. Helen&rsquo;s rubbers were almost
submerged and there seemed to be nothing
to keep Lucy&rsquo;s shoes and finally Lucy from going
the way of the rubbers.</p>

<p>Nan dropped her books, umbrella and lunch
on the bank and pulled a rail from the fence.
Lucy clutched it and with a great pull and a
sudden lurch which sent Nan backwards into the
blackberry bushes, the younger girl came hurtling
from what had threatened to become her
muddy grave.</p>

<p>The train was whistling, so they had to forego
the giggling fit that was upon them and run for
the station. The small branch that they must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
pass before they got there, was swollen beyond
recognition, but one stepping-stone obligingly
projected above water and with a mighty leap
they were over. The accommodating accommodation
train reached the station of Grantly before
they did, but the kindly engineer and conductor
waited patiently while the girls, puffing and
panting, raced up the hill.</p>

<p>They had hardly recovered their breath
when Billy and Mag boarded the train at
Preston.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you girls aren&rsquo;t spunky!&rdquo; cried
Billy admiringly as he sank in the seat by Nan,
which Lucy had tactfully vacated, sharing the
one with Mag. &ldquo;Mag and I were betting you
couldn&rsquo;t make it this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We just did and that is all,&rdquo; laughed Nan,
recounting the perils of the way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And only look at my boots! Did you ever
see such sights?&rdquo; cried Lucy. &ldquo;Oh, Heavens!
One of Helen&rsquo;s rubbers is gone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That must have happened when I fished you
out with the fence rail. I heard a terrible sough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
but didn&rsquo;t realize what it meant. They were so
much too small for you,&rdquo; said Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Small, indeed! They were too big. Their
coming off proves they were too big,&rdquo; insisted
Lucy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad your feet didn&rsquo;t come off too,
then,&rdquo; teased Nan. &ldquo;At one time I thought
they were going to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Billy produced a very shady handkerchief
from a hip pocket and proceeded to wipe off the
girls&rsquo; shoes, while he sang the sad song of the
Three Flies:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&ldquo;&lsquo;There were three flies inclined to roam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They thought they were tired of staying at home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So away they went with a skip and a hop<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till they came to the door of a grocer-ri shop.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&ldquo;&lsquo;Away they went with a merry, merry buz-zz,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till they came to a tub of mo-las-i-uz,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They never stopped a minute<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But plunged right in it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rubbed their noses and their pretty wings in it.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&ldquo;&lsquo;And there they stuck, and stuck, and stuck,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there they cussed their miserable luck,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With nobody by<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a greenbottle fly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who didn&rsquo;t give a darn for their miser-ri.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></div></div></div>

<p>&ldquo;But what I am worrying about,&rdquo; he continued
when his song had been applauded, &ldquo;is
how you are going to get home. Our car has
been put out of commission for the winter. Mag
and I had to foot it over the hill this morning,
but our path is high and dry, while the road to
Grantly is something fierce. If you get off at
Preston and go home with us, I&rsquo;ll get a rig and
drive you over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed, we couldn&rsquo;t think of it,&rdquo; objected
Nan. &ldquo;This is only the beginning of
winter and we can&rsquo;t get off at Preston every day
and impose on you and your father&rsquo;s horses to
get us home. We shall just have to get some
top boots and get through the mud somehow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t know that stream. If it was
high this morning, by afternoon it will be way
up. The Misses Grant should have told you
what you were to expect. They should have a
bridge there, but it seems Miss Ella wants a rustic
bridge and Miss Louise thinks a stone bridge
would be better, so they go a century with nothing
but a ford.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Going home I mean to pull another rail off
the fence and do some pole vaulting,&rdquo; declared
Lucy. &ldquo;I hope I can find Helen&rsquo;s big old rubber
I left sticking in the mud.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may stay there until the spring thawing,&rdquo;
said Mag. &ldquo;You had better stick to the path
going home. It is better to stick than get stuck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I had some stilts,&rdquo; sighed Nan.
&ldquo;They would carry me over like seven league
boots.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you walk on them?&rdquo; asked Billy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure! Walking on stilts is my one athletic
stunt,&rdquo; laughed Nan. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t tried for years
but I used to do it with extreme grace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That afternoon Billy had a mysterious package
that he stowed under the seats in the coach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What on earth is that?&rdquo; demanded Mag.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Larroes to catch meddlers!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, Billy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s nothing but some fence rails to
help Nan and Lucy get home. I&rsquo;m afraid the
Misses Grant will object if they pull down a
fence every time they get stuck in the mud.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>The parcel proved to contain two pairs of
bright red stilts found at a gentleman&rsquo;s furnishing
store. They had been used to advertise a
certain grade of very reliable trousers, of an
English cut. Just before the train reached
Preston Billy unearthed them and presented
Nan and Lucy each with a pair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here are some straps, too, to put on your
books to sling them over your shoulders. You
can&rsquo;t walk on stilts and carry things in your
hands at the same time. Tie your umbrellas to
the stilts! So long!&rdquo; and Billy fled from the
coach before the delighted girls could thank him.</p>

<p>Going home over the muddy road was very
different from the walk they had taken that
morning. In the first place it had stopped raining
and their umbrellas could be closed and tied
to the stilts. The air was cold and crisp now and
there was a hint of snow. They stopped in the
little station long enough to strap their books
securely and get their packs on their backs, and
then, mounting their steeds, they started on their
way rejoicing.</p>

<hr class="l1" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if I can walk,&rdquo; squealed Nan. &ldquo;It
has been years and years since I tried,&rdquo; and she
balanced herself daintily on the great long red
legs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you can! Once a stilt walker, always
a stilt walker!&rdquo; cried Lucy, starting
bravely off.</p>

<p>Nan found the art was not lost and followed
her sister down the muddy hill to the branch.
Billy was right: it had been high in the morning
but was much higher in the afternoon. The one
stepping-stone that had kept its nose above water
on their trip to town was now completely submerged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ugggh!&rdquo; exclaimed Lucy. &ldquo;My legs are
floating!&rdquo; And indeed it was a difficult feat to
walk through deep rushing water on stilts.
They have a way of floating off unless you put
them down with a most determined push and
bear your whole weight on them as you step.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at me! I can get through the water
if I goose step!&rdquo; cried Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this the best fun ever? Oh, Nan, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
pretty near love Billy for thinking of such a
thing. Don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t say love exactly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would! I can&rsquo;t see the use in beating
&rsquo;round the bush about such matters. He is certainly
the nicest person we know and does more
kind things for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is nice and I do like him a lot,&rdquo; confessed
Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better than the count and Mr. Tom Smith?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what they have to do with it,&rdquo; and
Nan got rosy from her exertion of goose stepping
through the water and up the muddy hill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, the old count talked about taking a
trip with you to the land of dreaming, wherever
that is, and Tom Smith took you on fine flying
bats, but Billy here, he gets some stilts for you
and lets you help yourself through the mud. I
say, give me Billy every time!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Billy is a nice boy; but Count de Lestis is an
elegant, cultured gentleman; and Tom Smith&mdash;Tom
Smith&mdash;he&mdash;he&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess you are right&mdash;Tom Smith, Tom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Smith he he! But flying machines wouldn&rsquo;t do
much good here in the mud, and stilts will get
us over the branch dry shod. There&rsquo;s Helen&rsquo;s
rubber!&rdquo; and Lucy adroitly lifted the little
muddy shoe out of the mire on the end of one of
her stilts and with a skillful twist of the wrist
flopped it onto dry ground.</p>

<p>When they reached the top of the hill where
the road became better they hid their stilts in the
bushes, up close to the fence, carefully covering
them with dry leaves and brush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our flamingo legs,&rdquo; Nan called them. During
that winter many times the girls crossed the
swollen stream on those red stilts and truly
thanked the kind Billy Sutton who had thought
of them. They would cache them under the little
station, there patiently and safely to await
their return.</p>

<p>It was always hard to walk through the water
and on one dire occasion when the stream was
outdoing itself, having burst all bounds and
spread far up on the road, poor Nan goose
stepped too far and fell backwards in the water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Fortunately it was on her homeward journey
and she could get to Valhalla and change her
dripping garments. She came across the following
limerick of Frost&rsquo;s which she gleefully
learned, feeling that it suited her case exactly:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&ldquo;&lsquo;There was once a gay red flamingo<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who said: By the Great Jumping Jingo!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I&rsquo;ve been in this clime<br /></span>
<span class="i2">An uncommon long time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But have not yet mastered their lingo.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />

<span class="f8">PARADISE</span></h2>


<p>It was astonishing how quickly that winter of
1916 and &rsquo;17 passed for those sojourners in
Valhalla in spite of the fact that they were at
times thoroughly uncomfortable. It is not an
easy matter for persons, brought up in a modern,
steam-heated house with three bath rooms, every
form of convenience and plenty of trained servants,
to adapt themselves to the simplicity of
country life and that in its most primitive state.</p>

<p>Hard as the life was it agreed with them, one
and all. Douglas and Bobby walked to school,
rain or shine, but their road lay in the uplands
where the mud rarely got more than ankle deep.
Nan and Lucy had to contend with much more
serious conditions, but thanks to their flamingo
legs they got by.</p>

<p>The weather wasn&rsquo;t always bad by any means.
There were wonderful clear sparkling days with
the ground frozen hard, and then came the snow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
that meant sleigh rides with the Suttons and
grand coasting parties.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter was growing very robust from his
labors of stopping up cracks and cutting fire
wood. He gradually mended the leaks in the
roof; puttied in the window panes; replaced the
broken hinges and fastenings to doors and shutters;
propped up sagging porch floors; and
patched the cracked and fallen plastering.</p>

<p>The Misses Grant viewed his efforts with
mingled satisfaction and embarrassment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have intended to do all this for you, Mr.
Carter, but Ella was so stubborn about the carpenter.
She never would agree to having that
new man at Preston, who is really quite capable,&rdquo;
Miss Louise would explain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not! We knew nothing about
him and have always employed Dave
Trigg&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you know perfectly well that Dave
Trigg is doubled up with rheumatism,&rdquo; snapped
Miss Louise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and you know perfectly well, too, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
that man at Preston has moved away,&rdquo; retaliated
her tall sister, and so on would they wrangle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I enjoy doing it,&rdquo; Mr. Carter would assure
them. &ldquo;My only fear is that I will get the place
in such good order that you will raise our rent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Which sally would delight the souls of the
ladies who were in danger of agreeing about one
more thing, and that was the altogether desirability
of the Carters and the especial desirability
of Mr. Carter.</p>

<p>Accepting Mrs. Carter at the extremely high
valuation of her patient family, they were ever
kind and considerate of her. Many were the
dainty little dishes they sent to Valhalla from
the great house to tempt the palate of their semi-invalid
tenant, vying with each other in their attentions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; she jes&rsquo; sets back an&rsquo; takes it,&rdquo; Chloe
would mutter. &ldquo;Mis&rsquo; Carter done set back so
much that settin&rsquo; back come nachel ter her now.</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&ldquo;&lsquo;My name is Jimmie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An&rsquo; I take all yer gimme.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my ol&rsquo; Mis&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>Chloe and Helen had continued the lessons
in reading and writing. The whitewashed
kitchen walls bore evidence to much hard work
on part of both teacher and pupil. Chloe had
learned to cook many simple dishes and to write
and spell all she cooked. By slow stages, so slow
they were almost imperceptible, the girl was becoming
an efficient servant. Her wages were
raised to eight dollars a month in spite of the
remonstrances of her sister Tempy, who thought
she must serve as long as she had before she
could make as much.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sis Tempy been a-goin&rsquo; over ter night school
at the count&rsquo;s ev&rsquo;y time she gits a chanst but she
ain&rsquo;t ter say larned nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen and Chloe were engaged in the delectable
task of making mince pies for Christmas.
Chloe had just electrified Helen by writing on
the wall of her own accord: &ldquo;Reseat fer miCe
Pize.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does she learn?&rdquo; asked Helen, smiling
as she deftly rolled the pastry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She say they done started a kinder &lsquo;batin&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
siety an&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t ter say foolin&rsquo; much with readin&rsquo;
an&rsquo; writin&rsquo; an&rsquo; sich. The secondary ain&rsquo;t so patient
as what you is, an&rsquo; he uster git kinder
worked up whin the niggers wint ter sleep in
school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fancy that would be trying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;s drillin&rsquo; &rsquo;em now an&rsquo; they likes that
&rsquo;cause the secondary done promised them from
the count that some day he&rsquo;ll gib &rsquo;em uniforms.
Niggers is allus keen on begalia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does Tempy drill, too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lawsamussy, no! Women folks jes&rsquo; sets
an&rsquo; watches. Tempy say she done march aroun&rsquo;
enough fer Miss Ellanlouise, an&rsquo; as fer flingin&rsquo;
broomsticks&mdash;she does enough of that &rsquo;thout no
German gemmun a-showin&rsquo; her nothin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout
how ter do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do they drill with broomsticks?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yassum, that&rsquo;s what they tell me, but they
do say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say what?&rdquo; asked Helen as the colored girl
hesitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t say nothin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You started to tell me something they say
about broomsticks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t started ter tell a thing!&rdquo; and Chloe
shut her mouth very tight and rolled her eyes
back in a way she had that made you think she
was going to turn herself inside out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do they debate about?&rdquo; asked Helen
amused at Chloe&rsquo;s sudden reserve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They &rsquo;spute &rsquo;bout the pros an&rsquo; cons of
racin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Horse racing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t so sho&rsquo;, but from what Sis Tempy
done tol&rsquo; me it mought be an&rsquo; agin it moughtn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does Tempy debate?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sis Tempy! Yi! Yi!&rdquo; and Chloe went off
in peals of laughter. &ldquo;Sis Tempy can&rsquo;t argyfy
with nothin&rsquo; but a rollin&rsquo; pin. She done put up a
right good argymint only las&rsquo; Sunday with her
beau, that big slue-footed nigger, Jeemes
Hanks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was the argument about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jeemes he done say he&rsquo;s jes&rsquo; as good as any
white folks an&rsquo; some better&rsquo;n a heap er them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
He say his vote don&rsquo;t count none an&rsquo; he ain&rsquo;t
able ter buy no good lan&rsquo; jes&rsquo; &rsquo;cause de white
folks won&rsquo;t sell him none up clost ter they homes,&mdash;an&rsquo;
Sis Tempy ups an&rsquo; tells him that his vote
ain&rsquo;t no count &rsquo;cause he ain&rsquo;t no count hisse&rsquo;f.
She tells him that buzzards lays buzzard eggs an&rsquo;
buzzard eggs hatches out mo&rsquo; buzzards; an&rsquo; that
made him hoppin&rsquo; mad &rsquo;cause that nigger Jeemes
sho&rsquo; do set great sto&rsquo; by hisse&rsquo;f.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does James feel that white people ought to
sell him land whether they want to or not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Zactly! He been wantin&rsquo; ter buy a strip
from Miss Ellanlouise up yander by the clari&rsquo;,
not so fur from the great house. They&rsquo;s glad
enough ter sell some er that rocky lan&rsquo; off over
by the gravel pit, but they don&rsquo;t want no niggers
fer clost neighbors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what did Tempy say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She never said nothin&rsquo;. She jes&rsquo; up&rsquo;n driv
him out&rsquo;n the cabin with the rollin&rsquo; pin. She tells
him while she&rsquo;s a-lickin&rsquo; him, though, that he&rsquo;s
a-larnin&rsquo; his a-b-c&rsquo;s upside down at the count&rsquo;s
school an&rsquo; fer her part she ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; back.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think the count is responsible for
James&rsquo;s nonsense?&rdquo; asked Helen. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see
how he got such notions from a gentleman like
the count.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a-sayin&rsquo;! I ain&rsquo;t a-sayin&rsquo;!&rdquo; and once
more Chloe&rsquo;s mouth went shut with a determined
click and she rolled her great eyes.</p>

<p>Helen thought no more about it. Darkies
were funny creatures, anyhow. Of course it was
hard on James Hanks if he wanted to buy good
ground and no one would sell it to him, but on
the other hand one could hardly expect the
Misses Grant to sell off their ancestral acres just
to accommodate the slue-footed beau of their
cook.</p>

<p>Miss Ella and Louise were entirely unreconstructed
as far as the colored people were concerned.
They were kind to them when they were
ill and helped them in many ways, but they never
for an instant lost sight of the fact that they
were of an inferior race nor did they let the darkies
lose sight of the fact. They were not very
popular with their negro neighbors although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
they were mutually dependent. Grantly had to
depend on colored labor and many families
among them got their entire living from Grantly.</p>

<p>The medicine chest at the great house furnished
castor oil and paregoric for all the sick
pickaninnies for miles around; Miss Louise had
to make up great jars of her wintergreen ointment
so that the aching joints of many an old
aunty or uncle might find some ease; while Miss
Ella&rsquo;s willow bark and wild cherry tonic warded
off chills and fevers from the mosquito infested
districts down in the settlement in the
swamps.</p>

<p>The older members of the community of negroes
appreciated the real goodness and kindness
of the two old ladies and overlooked their
overbearing ways, but the younger generation,
who cared not for the ointment or tonic, could
see nothing but arrogance in the really harmless
old spinsters.</p>

<p>Most of the former slaves, who had at one time
belonged to Grantly, had passed away. The few
who remained were old and feeble and these had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
many arguments with the younger ones, trying
to make them see the real kindness and goodness
of Miss Ellanlouise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You done got fat on castor ile out&rsquo;n the chist
at Grantly whin you was a sickly baby,&rdquo; old
Uncle Abe Hanks would say to his refractory
grandson Jeemes. &ldquo;An&rsquo; you an&rsquo; yo&rsquo; paw befo&rsquo;
you was pulled from the grabe by parrygoric
from dat same chist, an&rsquo; now you set up here an&rsquo;
say: &lsquo;Down with southe&rsquo;n &lsquo;ristocrats!&rsquo; Humph!
You&rsquo;d better be a-sayin&rsquo;: &lsquo;Down with the castor
ile an&rsquo; parrygoric!&rsquo; &lsquo;Down with the good
strong soup an&rsquo; fat back Miss Ellanlouise done
sent yo&rsquo; ol&rsquo; gran&rsquo;pap las&rsquo; winter whin there
warn&rsquo;t hide or har er his own flesh an&rsquo; blood come
nigh him!&rsquo; Yes! They went down all right&mdash;down
the red lane. You free niggers is got the
notion you kin live &rsquo;thout the &rsquo;ristocrats. Why
don&rsquo;t you go an&rsquo; live &rsquo;thout &rsquo;em then? Nobody
ain&rsquo;t a-holdin&rsquo; you. As fer me&mdash;gib me &rsquo;ristocrats
ev&rsquo;y time!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Count de Lestis is as &rsquo;ristocratical as
those ol&rsquo; tabbies,&rdquo; the grandson would reply sullenly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
&ldquo;and he doesn&rsquo;t treat a colored gemman
like he was a houn&rsquo; dog.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ristocratical much! That furrener? You
ain&rsquo;t got good sinse, boy. That there pretty little
count didn&rsquo;t even come from Virginny an&rsquo;
all the &rsquo;ristocrats done come from Virginny one
time er anudder. I done hear Ol&rsquo; Marster say
dat time an&rsquo; time agin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The count say he gonter sell us all the lan&rsquo;
we want. An&rsquo; he say he gonter fetch over some
nice, kind white folks ter live neighbors to us;
white folks what is jes&rsquo; as good as these white
folks &rsquo;roun&rsquo; here but who ain&rsquo;t a-gonter hol&rsquo; theyselves
so proudified like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! I kin see him now tu&rsquo;nnin&rsquo; loose a lot
er po&rsquo; white Guinnies what will take the bread
out&rsquo;n the mouth er the nigger. Them po&rsquo; white
furreners kin live on buzzard meat, an&rsquo; dey don&rsquo;
min&rsquo; wuckin&rsquo; day in an&rsquo; day out, an&rsquo; if&rsquo;n dey gits
a holt in the lan&rsquo; the nigger&rsquo;ll hab ter go. As
fer a-livin&rsquo; long side er niggers,&mdash;I tell you now,
son, that the white folks what don&rsquo;t min&rsquo; a-livin&rsquo;
long side er niggers is wuss&rsquo;n niggers, an&rsquo; I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
can&rsquo;t say no mo&rsquo; scurrilous thing about them
than that&mdash;wuss&rsquo;n niggers!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A strong discontent was certainly brewing
among the younger generation of negroes. Conversations
similar to the one between Uncle Abe
Hanks and James were not uncommon in the
settlement that lay midway between Grantly and
Weston. This settlement was known by the
exceedingly appropriate name of Paradise.
There were about a dozen cabins there, some of
them quite comfortable and neat, others very
poor and forlorn.</p>

<p>There was a church, the pride of their
simple hearts because it was built of brick;
also a ramshackled old building known as
&ldquo;The Club.&rdquo; This club had originally been a
tobacco barn, built, of course, without windows,
for the curing of tobacco. In converting it into
a club house, windows had been cut in the sides
but with no fixed plan. Wherever a member
decided it would be nice to have a window, a
window was cut. No two were the same size or
on the same level. Most of them were more or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
less on the slant, giving the building the appearance
of having survived an earthquake.</p>

<p>In this club house the secret societies met to
hold their mysterious rites. Here they had their
festivals and bazaars and sometimes, when the
effects of protracted meetings had worn off and
the ungodly were again to the fore, they would
have dances that threatened to bring down the
walls and roof of the rickety building. It was
whispered through the county that a blind tiger
was also operated there but this was not proven.
Certainly there was much drunkenness at times
in Paradise, considering the state was dry.</p>

<p>Count de Lestis was very popular in Paradise.
He always had a kind word for old and
young. Then, too, he had work for them and
paid them well. His fame spread and actually
there was a boom in Paradise. Other negroes in
settlements near by were anxious to move to
Paradise. Town lots were in demand and the
club had a waiting list for membership. The
church was full to overflowing when on Sunday
Brother Si took his stand in the little pulpit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>Night school at Weston was something new
and something to do, so the darkies flocked to it.
Herz, the secretary, had his hands full trying to
teach the mob that congregated three times a
week to sit at the feet of learning. He did get
angry occasionally when his pupils, tired out no
doubt after a hard day&rsquo;s work, would fall asleep
with audible attestations.</p>

<hr class="l1" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />

<span class="f8">HERZ</span></h2>


<p>Herz was in such strong contrast to his employer,
the count, that he gave Helen and Douglas
quite a shock when they first met him. They
had walked over to Weston with their father,
who had been prevailed upon to take the order
for the restoration of the old mansion. Dr.
Wright had been consulted as to the advisability
of his trying to do this work and had approved
of it as being something to occupy his patient
without making him nervous. It meant many
trips to Weston on the part of Mr. Carter and
equally many to Valhalla on the part of the
count.</p>

<p>De Lestis had done very little talking about
Herz, mentioning him usually rather in the tone
of one speaking of a servant, but Helen came
to the opinion the moment she looked at him that
there was nothing servile about him; on the contrary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
he was evidently the more intellectual of
the two men. He was a little younger than the
count, much taller, with broad spare shoulders
and a back as straight as a board. His blue eyes
were very near sighted, necessitating the wearing
of very thick lenses in his large gold-rimmed
spectacles. His hair was yellow and grew
straight up on his head like wheat stubble. His
brow was broad and high and well shaped. He
really was a handsome man except that his
mouth was too full lipped and so very red. His
English was perfect with no touch of accent as
with the count. He said he had been born in
Cincinnati and his father was a naturalized
American, so even Douglas, the strong pro ally,
had to accept him as German in name only.</p>

<p>Weston was a good three miles from Grantly
by the road, but much closer if one took a path
through the woods, skirting Paradise and approaching
the old house from the rear. Truly it
had been a grand estate in its day and de Lestis
was determined to restore it to its pristine glory.
He had owned the place about a year and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
accomplished much in that time. The fences and
gates were in perfect repair; the fields showed
that good farming theories had already been put
into practice; the woods, that some knowledge of
forestry had been applied, as the undergrowth
had been cleared away and useless timber been
cut down to give room to valuable trees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a lot of money must have been spent
here,&rdquo; said Douglas, noting the new fencing and
well-built barns as they approached the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, de Lestis seems to have unlimited supplies
of cash. I fancy he is a man of great
wealth,&rdquo; said Mr. Carter. &ldquo;I have ordered a
Delco light to be installed in his house. He
spares no expense in restoring the old place. I
was rather opposed to having the new lighting
system. It seems such an anomaly in a colonial
mansion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Daddy, you wouldn&rsquo;t want the count to
grope his way around with tallow dips,&rdquo; laughed
Helen. &ldquo;I fancy that was what was used when
Weston was first built.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have him do it rather than ruin the architectural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
effect of such a wonderful old house; but
de Lestis has his own ideas about things and all
he wants of me, after all, is to do the work of a
contractor. As for Herz,&mdash;he has better taste
than de Lestis, I believe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell us about Herz, Daddy. You never
have told us what he is like,&rdquo; demanded Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You judge for yourselves,&rdquo; answered the father.</p>

<p>The truth was that Mr. Carter had not known
just what to make of Herz. Clever he was certainly
and no underling, as they had gathered
from de Lestis.</p>

<p>This was the girls&rsquo; first visit to Weston although
the count had urged their coming many
times. Douglas&rsquo;s school was dismissed for the
Christmas holidays and she felt like a bird out of
the cage: two whole weeks of delightful freedom
ahead of her!</p>

<p>Teaching had come easy to her and she had
conquered Bobby and the other unruly pupils
and felt that she was in a way getting on top of
her work. The days passed rapidly and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
school was in a fine condition, enthusiastic pupils
and eager students. Nevertheless it was great
to be having a holiday and she meant to make the
most of it. She and Helen were planning a trip
to Richmond after Christmas to visit Cousin
Elizabeth Somerville. Lewis was stationed
there with his company and his duties not being
so very arduous, he hoped to spend much time
with his favorite cousin. Valhalla was very
lovely and the girls had grown very fond of it.
Their plans for their father were working out
and they knew they had done right in taking the
place and moving the family to the country, but
nevertheless they were looking forward with
pleasure to the visit to Richmond and release
from all of their duties for a few days.</p>

<p>What glowing girls they were! Robert Carter
looked at them with pardonable pride as they
tramped through the woods, their cheeks crimson
with the exercise in the cold air. How they
had shown the &ldquo;mettle of their pasture&rdquo; when
the time came for them to take hold! He had
always known that Douglas had a certain bulldog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
tenacity that would make her keep her grip
no matter what happened, but Helen had astonished
him. When something had snapped in his
tired brain he had instinctively turned to Douglas
as the person to decide for the family welfare,
but Helen had shown herself capable far
beyond his hopes. He well knew that her part
of the work was most difficult, and he saw with
wonder her patience with her mother and with
the seemingly impossible Chloe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make it all up to them,&rdquo; he said to himself.</p>

<p>The doctor&rsquo;s prescription of country life and
freedom from care with plenty of occupation for
his hands was working wonders. This work he
had been doing for de Lestis was not taxing his
mind at all, and he suddenly realized that it was
not because it was so easy but because his mind
was in working order again. He felt his old
power coming back to him, the power of concentration,
of initiative. Sometimes he would
try to lie awake at night just for the pleasure of
feeling himself to be well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>His illness had been a blessing in disguise
since it had brought out all this latent fineness
in his girls. It had somehow made them more
beautiful, too, at least they seemed so in the eyes
of their doting father.</p>

<p>Approaching Weston from the rear, no one
was in sight. Smoke arising from the kitchen
chimney gave evidence of a servant&rsquo;s being somewhere.
The yard was in perfect order, with no
unsightly ash pile or tin cans to offend the eye.
To one side Mr. Carter pointed out the rose garden
that the count had taken much care of,
spending hundreds of dollars on every known
variety that would flourish in that latitude. Beyond
were greenhouses and hot beds that furnished
lettuce and cauliflower and spinach
through the winter for the master&rsquo;s delicate palate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it lovely?&rdquo; gasped Helen. &ldquo;It must
be splendid to be rich.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mounting the broad steps leading to the pillared
gallery they heard voices speaking in some
foreign language, they could not tell whether it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
was German or not, and then a loud laugh and
&ldquo;Ach Gott!&rdquo; in the count&rsquo;s unmistakable baritone.
Through the window they saw the two
men, de Lestis and Herz, bending over a table
spread with papers. Herz was pointing out
something to his employer which seemed to delight
him, as he was laughing heartily. This was
gathered only by one glance, as immediately the
Carters passed beyond the angle through which
they could view the interior of the room and Mr.
Carter knocked on the front door.</p>

<p>The door was not opened for several minutes.
Evidently the count employed servants for such
tasks and did not believe in opening doors with
his own august hands. Helen gave an impatient
rat tat again. She was not fond of waiting.
The door was opened suddenly and by the
count.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! My good friends!&rdquo; he exclaimed enthusiastically.
&ldquo;I did not expect you until tomorrow,
my dear Mr. Carter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came a day sooner because my daughters
could come with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And what an honor!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He ushered them into the room where they
had viewed him for the moment in passing.
There were no papers on the table now and
everything was in perfect order. The secretary
was standing at attention, awaiting an introduction
to the ladies.</p>

<p>He bowed from his waist up, shutting up like
a jack-knife. He had not the easy, graceful manners
of the count, but seemed much blunter and
less polished. One could not fancy his kissing
the hand of a lady as the count was famous for
doing.</p>

<p>Love at first sight is supposed to happen only
in books but it does happen sometimes in real
life, and on that frosty day in December it came
to pass in the library at Weston, came like a
flash of lightning, came without warning and
without being wanted. Certainly the secretary
had not wanted to stop the work he was engaged
in that seemed to be so engrossing; he did not
even want to meet these Carter girls but had
been forced into it by his employer. What good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
would it do him to fall in love? He cared not a
whit for women, anyhow, despised them in fact.
But the little blind god, Cupid, took none of
these things into consideration. He simply let
fly his dart and as Adolph Herz straightened
himself up after making his stiff, jack-knife bow,
the arrow hit him square in his heart.</p>

<p>It was a toss of the penny which sister it
should be; both of them were lovely, both of them
rosy and charming. He looked at Douglas first,
however, and never saw Helen at all, at least,
seemed not to. He did not take his eyes from
Douglas&rsquo;s face during the entire call.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has the lighting system come yet?&rdquo; asked
Mr. Carter. &ldquo;It should have been here by
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you order one?&rdquo; asked the count. &ldquo;I
understood I was to send the order and have
done so. You sent it off, did you not, Herz?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly! A week ago!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you told me to order it,&rdquo; insisted Mr.
Carter. &ldquo;I am sure you did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, that is all right, my dear fellow,&rdquo; said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
the count very kindly. &ldquo;If both of them come
it will make no difference. I can install one of
them in the barn and garage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I cannot let you have the expense of
both if I was at fault,&rdquo; and Mr. Carter looked
distressed. Was his head not behaving as it
should, after all?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, my dear Mr. Carter, it might easily
have been my mistake and I cannot have you
bothered about it. The expense is trifling. Miss
Helen, help me to persuade your father that it
is nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The count&rsquo;s manner was so kindly and he
seemed so anxious to make Mr. Carter feel that
if any mistake had been made he, the count, had
made it that Helen was deeply grateful. How
much she liked this foreign nobleman, anyhow.
He was always so gracious, so suave, so elegant.
His heart must be tender, his disposition good,
or how could he make all of the poor colored people
like him so much? Helen was fully aware
of the fact that the count was attracted by her,
but there had been times when she was sure he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
was equally taken with Douglas, and certainly
his manner to Nan on several occasions had been
one of devotion. He always seemed to be coming
out on the train with Nan and Lucy, and
Lucy had intimated that he had caused Billy
Sutton many sad hours by &ldquo;hogging&rdquo; the seat
by Nan. Could he be a flirt? Helen put the
thought from her. She hated a male flirt.
Nevertheless she was conscious of the fact that
she had a little tiny twinge of jealousy, so tiny
that it was only a speck, but it was there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Douglas&rsquo;s hair and Nan&rsquo;s eyes,&rdquo; she
thought. &ldquo;I believe he thinks I&rsquo;m more interesting
than they are, though,&rdquo; and then she took
herself to task for a foolish, vain girl. &ldquo;What
difference does it make to me, anyhow? What
do we know of this stranger and what is he to
us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now the girls gave their attention to the estate,
for they were naturally interested in the
work their father had undertaken. The workmen
were through, carpenters, plasterers and
painters, and the place had been turned over to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Count de Lestis. Very beautiful it was and one
for any owner to be proud of. The spacious hall,
with its waxed floor and beautiful stairway with
mahogany treads and bannisters, was as fine an
example of southern colonial as one could find in
the whole of Virginia. The furnishings were in
keeping with the general plan of the house, as at
Mr. Carter&rsquo;s suggestion an antique dealer and
decorator from Richmond had had his finger in
the pie. Much of the furniture had been bought
with the house, being old mahogany that had
been at Weston for more than a century.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How lovely it is!&rdquo; gasped Helen as the
doors to the great dining-room were thrown
open.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so glad you like it,&rdquo; whispered the
count in a very meaning tone. &ldquo;I have your father
to thank for its being so complete. Never
have I seen work carried on so rapidly. I was
afraid I would be living in the discomfort of
shavings and mortar beds for months to come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Daddy is always like that,&rdquo; said Helen smiling.
Nothing pleased Helen so much as praise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
of her father. &ldquo;He can always make workmen
work. They say in Richmond that not even
plumbers disappoint him. He always turns over
his houses on time unless there is something absolutely
unforeseen, like a strike or something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am indeed fortunate in having prevailed
upon him to do this for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he has enjoyed doing it so much. You
see Daddy has not been able to work for so long
and I think he had begun to feel that maybe he
had lost out, and this proves that he hasn&rsquo;t. He
does not know how to be idle. Why last summer
when he was supposed to do nothing but rest
he drew the plans and built bird houses for
Bobby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, indeed! I am so glad you reminded me
of something. Mr. Carter,&rdquo; he called to that
gentleman who was critically examining some
electric wiring recently put in ready for the
Delco batteries which were on the way, &ldquo;I want
now some plans for bird houses if such trivial
work is not beneath you. I want bird houses
for every kind of feathered songster that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
can be attracted and persuaded to live at Weston.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How wonderful!&rdquo; cried Helen and Douglas
in chorus. Douglas had been engaged in conversation
by the secretary, who was limbering up
in an amazing manner. He was most attentive,
showing her into every nook and cranny of the
old house. He opened sideboards and cabinets
to reveal the exquisite finish of the satinwood
drawers and shelves; he took down bits of rare
old china from the plate rack in the dining-room,
explaining the marks on the bottoms. He was
so kind that Douglas almost liked him, but not
quite.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Adolph Herz is too German in sound,&rdquo; the
Anglo-Saxon in her cried out. &ldquo;And then his
mouth! It is so red!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly I&rsquo;ll enjoy drawing plans for bird
houses,&rdquo; laughed Mr. Carter. &ldquo;I shall even
take pleasure in carpentering them. They are
really lots of fun to make.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I agree with you,&rdquo; said Herz. &ldquo;Simply
drawing a design is never so much pleasure as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
carrying it out. How a sculptor can be willing
to do only the clay modeling of his statue and
then let someone else carve the marble is more
than I can understand. When I think of something
to be done, I must do it myself&mdash;trust it to
no one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I am a lazy bones myself and anyone
can do my work,&rdquo; laughed the count. &ldquo;Now
Adolph here has drawn the plan for a pigeon
house and he wants to build it himself. I tell
him it is absurd, that any carpenter can carry out
his ideas, but he will not listen to me. Adolph
is a very stubborn man, Miss Carter.&rdquo; He addressed
this remark to Douglas who smiled at
the young secretary. He was frowning heavily
and his full lips were drawn into a hard red line.
The count caught his eye and gave him a bantering
look in return.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, Adolph, and show Mr. Carter
your plans for the pigeon house!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are not completed,&rdquo; he answered sullenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am quite a pigeon fancier,&rdquo; went on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
master of Weston. &ldquo;They are charming birds
to raise and one can make much money on
squabs. We are going into pigeon raising quite
seriously. I think we shall build a very large
house. Eh, Adolph?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where will you put the pigeon house?&rdquo;
asked Mr. Carter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right there on the roof, about in the centre
of the house,&rdquo; said the count, pointing to the top
of the mansion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not there! Surely you would not do such
a thing!&rdquo; cried Helen incredulously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would ruin the architectural effect of
Weston,&rdquo; declared Mr. Carter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I know it would,&rdquo; maintained the architect
stoutly. &ldquo;Why, de Lestis, all of my
work would be as nothing if you should
put a pigeon house there. I beg of you not
to!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my dear Mr. Carter, I am a pigeon
fancier and want my pigeons at a point where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
I can watch them twirling and dipping. I love
their cooing, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right! It is your house and you can do
as you choose with it, but please do not mention
me as the architect who restored the place. I
cannot stand for such a piece of Philistinism.&rdquo;
Mr. Carter laughed as he made the above remark,
but his daughters knew by a certain look
in his eyes that he was angry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you to have carrier pigeons?&rdquo; asked
Douglas, hoping to relieve the company of an
embarrassment that seemed to have fallen upon
it.</p>

<p>The secretary still had his mouth drawn in a
stern line although he had smoothed his frowning
brow. Helen was plainly put out at the count&rsquo;s
daring to go against her father&rsquo;s artistic taste,
while Count de Lestis seemed to be taking a kind
of delight in teasing everybody.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will promise to send me a message, I
will,&rdquo; he answered gallantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that would be great fun! I have never
seen a carrier pigeon.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>The count then devoted himself to Douglas
for the rest of the visit, showing her the pantry
shelves that he had on one occasion expressed
himself as desirous for Helen to pass on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All we need now is a lady of the manor,&rdquo; he
said in a low tone. &ldquo;It is not meet for man to
live alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Douglas looked at him quite frankly, her blue
eyes steady as she gazed into his black ones.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t your mother come and keep house for
you?&rdquo; she asked quite simply.</p>

<p>There was no flirting in Douglas Carter&rsquo;s
make-up. Herz, who refused to go far from her
in spite of the count&rsquo;s sudden devoted attentions,
relaxed his grim expression that he had held ever
since the pigeon house had been the subject of
conversation. His mouth broke into a smile and
his easy manner returned.</p>

<p>The Carters soon took their departure, although
the master of the house was insistent that
they should stay to tea with them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must get back to Valhalla,&rdquo; declared
Douglas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Valhalla! Is that the name of your place?&rdquo;
asked Herz.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the name my sister Nan gave it. She
says we are all more or less dead warriors when
the day is over. I don&rsquo;t like giving it such a
German name myself, but Nan says poetry is
universal and&mdash;&mdash; Oh! I beg your pardon!&rdquo;
The girl had forgotten that her companion was
of German birth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you dislike the Germans so much?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not the German people&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she stammered.
&ldquo;Just the Imperial Government!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But aren&rsquo;t the people the Government?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, so Miss Carter has opened fire on you,
too, has she?&rdquo; laughed de Lestis. &ldquo;If there
were more fighters like her among the Allies,
poor Germany would have her banners trailing
in the dust by now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not mean to be rude to Mr. Herz,&rdquo;
said Douglas. &ldquo;I am too prejudiced in favor
of France and England to remember my manners.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
If I have injured you, I beg your pardon,&rdquo;
and she gave the secretary her hand in
good-by.</p>

<p>He blushed like a schoolgirl and stammered
out some unintelligible something.</p>

<p>De Lestis renewed his attentions to Helen
just as though he had not been hovering over her
sister with tender nothings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a flirt!&rdquo; thought Helen. &ldquo;I think I
can give him as good as he sends, but I am beginning
to hate him.&rdquo; She dimpled to his remarks,
however, and as she bade him good-by at
the door she smiled saucily into his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To think of that man&rsquo;s being willing to ruin
his roof line,&rdquo; sighed Mr. Carter as he and his
daughters started on their homeward walk.
&ldquo;Just look how beautiful it is,&rdquo; pointing to the
old chimneys where the roof melted into the sky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a shame,&rdquo; cried Helen. &ldquo;But how cold
it is! There now, I left my gloves on the library
table.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run back and get them, honey; Douglas
and I will wait for you here by the stile.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>Helen ran back. Once more she glanced into
the library where on their arrival they had
caught a glimpse of the two men bending over
the papers. Now what was her astonishment to
see the secretary actually shaking the count, who
was laughing heartily. The secretary&rsquo;s eyes
were flashing as he blurted out the words:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fool! Fool!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The count opened the door quickly this time
at her knock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your gloves! I found them and almost
hoped you would leave them with me, but the
little hands would have been so cold. Indeed,
they are so cold,&rdquo; and he gallantly kissed them.</p>

<p>Helen seized her gloves and with glowing
cheeks raced back to her father and sister. She
gave her hands a vigorous rubbing on her grey
corduroy skirt before she put on her gloves as
though she might rub off the kiss. In the excitement
over the dénouement of the visit she forgot
for the time being that she had caught the
secretary shaking his employer and calling him
a fool.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<span class="f8">GOOSE STEPPING</span></h2>


<p>The winter wore on. Our warriors were
fighting the good fight and each night as they
gathered round the cheerful fire in the great
chimney in the living-room at Valhalla they had
tales to tell of difficulties overcome. Of course
there were failures, many of them, but each failure
meant a lesson learned and better luck next
time.</p>

<p>Douglas had days when the little ideas refused
to shoot and her pupils seemed to be just so
many wooden dolls, but she learned the rare lesson,
that teachers must learn if they are to be
successful: when a class won&rsquo;t learn, and can&rsquo;t
learn, and doesn&rsquo;t want to learn, there is something
the matter with the teacher. When she
came to this realization she took herself to task,
and the dark days came farther and farther
apart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>The letter she had written Dr. Wright had
had a most salutary effect on Bobby. That
young physician had taken the naughty boy for
a long ride and had given him a man to man talk,
first temporarily dismissing him from his employ
and sternly forbidding him to hold out his
hand when they were going around corners. He
was not allowed to blow the horn at dangerous
curves and all of his honors were stripped from
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It nearly killed me to do it,&rdquo; George Wright
confessed to Helen. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t look him in
the eye for fear of weakening, but he took it like
the little man he is. I fancy Douglas will have
no more trouble with him for a while. I am
glad she asked me to help her out. It is no joke
to teach your own flesh and blood. Bobby says
he thought that Douglas was just playing school
and he didn&rsquo;t know he was really bothering her.
He knows now and is even prepared to lick any
boy not twice his size who disturbs his sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Count de Lestis seemed to have much business
that took him away from Weston. Sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
he was gone for several weeks at a time, but
when he returned he would drop in at Valhalla
as though he had not been away at all. He was
always a welcome visitor. Mrs. Carter greeted
him as a long lost friend. He seemed to be the
incarnation of the social world to the poor little
lady, destined to spend her days out of her element.
Mr. Carter had almost forgiven him the
pigeon house, but not quite.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is something lacking, somehow, in a
man who would do such a thing,&rdquo; he had declared
to Helen.</p>

<p>The pigeon house was built by the secretary,
according to his own plans and specifications,
and placed on the roof, where it loomed an eyesore
to the artistic. Truly they seemed to be
going into pigeon raising in good earnest. It
was a huge affair, large enough to accommodate
many pigeons; and then, with the careless expenditure
of money that seemed to characterize
the master of Weston, crates of pigeons arrived
and were installed in their new quarters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The carrier pigeons have not come, but when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
they do I&rsquo;ll bring one to you,&rdquo; the count said to
Douglas, &ldquo;and you must promise to send me a
message.&rdquo; The girl laughingly promised.</p>

<p>The count was still doing what Helen called
&ldquo;browsing.&rdquo; He flitted from sister to sister,
whispering his tender nothings and for the moment
seeming all devotion to the one with whom
he happened to be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness, I found out in time what a
flirt he is!&rdquo; Helen whispered to her inmost self.
&ldquo;Once, for just a fraction of a second, I was
jealous of Douglas and of Nan, too. His house
is so lovely and he is so rich and handsome and
so fascinating, and I do so hate to be poor! But
I can&rsquo;t abide a male flirt!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Helen was very glad to see the
count when he called at Valhalla and she was
very successful in hiding her real feelings from
that gentleman, who twirled his saucy moustache
in masculine satisfaction when he thought of the
attractive girl who so courteously received his
attentions. Douglas&rsquo;s indifference rather piqued
him and he was constantly trying to break<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
through it, but no matter what flattering remarks
he made to her she never seemed to know
they were intended for her, Douglas Carter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That young soldier is at the bottom of it!&rdquo;
he would exclaim to himself after trying his best
to get an answering spark from this girl who appeared
so altogether lovely in his eyes, more
lovely and desirable because of her indifference,
and then, too, because he knew instinctively that
Herz was hopelessly in love with her; and many
men are like sheep and go where others lead.</p>

<p>The secretary was becoming a real nuisance
to Douglas, who in a way liked him, but who
never got over his very German name and his
red, red mouth. He so often seemed to know
exactly the moment when she was to dismiss
school and would appear as she locked the schoolhouse
door and quietly join her on the walk
home. He was very interesting and Douglas
much preferred him to the count, who could not
be with any female for more than a few moments
without bordering on love-making of some kind.
Herz had a great deal of information and this he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
would impart to Douglas in quite the manner of
a professor as he walked stiffly by her side.</p>

<p>Bobby was not at all in favor of sharing the
walks home with this tall, stiff stranger. Ever
since Dr. Wright&rsquo;s talk with him he had considered
himself Douglas&rsquo;s protector, and he liked to
pretend that as they went along the lonesome
road and skirted the dark pine woods he was going
to shoot imaginary bandits who infested
their path. He couldn&rsquo;t play any such game
with this matter-of-fact man stalking along by
their side, explaining to Douglas some intricate
point in philosophy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, kin you goose step?&rdquo; he asked one day
when Herz was especially irritating to him.
Bobby had a &ldquo;bowanarrow&rdquo; hid in the bushes
by the branch, with which he had intended to kill
many Indians on their homeward walk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course!&rdquo; came rather impatiently
from Herz, who thought children should be seen
and not heard and that this especial child would
be well neither seen nor heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, do it!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Bobby, don&rsquo;t bother Mr. Herz,&rdquo; Douglas
admonished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He kin talk an&rsquo; goose step at the same time,&rdquo;
Bobby insisted.</p>

<p>Herz began solemnly to goose step, expounding
his philosophy as he went. Bobby shrieked
with delight. This wasn&rsquo;t such a bad companion,
after all. It was so ridiculous that Douglas
could hardly refrain from shouting as loud as
Bobby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that the way the German soldiers really
walk?&rdquo; asked Bobby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I am told.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you learn to do it?&rdquo; asked Douglas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;at a school where I was educated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but you are an American, so the count
told me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am an American.&rdquo; This was uttered in a
very dead tone. The man suddenly turned on
his heel and with a muttered good-by disappeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t he a nut, though?&rdquo; exclaimed Bobby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He is peculiar,&rdquo; agreed Douglas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you like for him to walk home with you,
Dug?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether I do or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t like it a bit, &rsquo;cep&rsquo;n, of co&rsquo;se,
when he goose steps an&rsquo; then it&rsquo;s great. I seen
a colored fellow a-goose steppin&rsquo; the other day,
an&rsquo; he says he learned it at the count&rsquo;s school
what Mr. Herz is a-teachin&rsquo;. He says they call
it settin&rsquo; up exercises, but he would like to do
some settin&rsquo; down exercise. I reckon he was
tryin&rsquo; to make a kinder joke.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="l1" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />

<span class="f8">AN EIGHTEENTH BIRTHDAY</span></h2>


<p>Every American will always remember that
winter of 1917 as being one of extreme unrest.
Would we or would we not be plunged into the
World War? Should we get in the game or
should we sit quietly by and see Germany overrun
land and sea?</p>

<p>Valhalla was not too much out of the world to
share in the excitement, and like most of the
world was divided in its opinions. Douglas and
her father were for the sword and no more pens.
Helen and Mrs. Carter felt it was a pity to mix
up in a row that was not ours, although in her
secret soul Helen knew full well that the row
was ours and if war was to be declared she would
be as good a fighter as the next. Nan was an
out and out pacifist and declared the world was
too beautiful to mar with all of this bloodshed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
Lucy insisted that Nan got her sentiments from
Count de Lestis, who had been &ldquo;hogging&rdquo; a
seat by her sister quite often in the weeks before
that day in March when diplomatic relations
with Germany were broken off by our country.
As for Lucy: she could tell you all about the
causes of the war and was quite up on Bismarck&rsquo;s
policy, etc. She delighted her father
with her knowledge of history and her logical
views of the present situation. She and Mag
were determined to go as Red Cross nurses if we
did declare war, certain that if they tucked up
their hair and let down their dresses no one
would dream they were only fourteen. Bobby
walked on his toes and held his head very high,
trying to look tall, hoping he could go as a drummer
boy or something if he could only stretch
himself a bit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good news, girls!&rdquo; cried Helen one evening
in February when they had drawn their seats
around the roaring fire piled high with wood cut
by Mr. Carter, whose muscles were getting as
hard as iron from his outdoor work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; in a chorus from the girls, always
ready for any kind of news, good or bad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The count is going to have a ball!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really? When?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the twenty-second of February! He
says if he gives a party on Washington&rsquo;s birthday
nobody can doubt his patriotism.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph! I don&rsquo;t see what business he has
with patriotism about our Washington,&rdquo; muttered
Lucy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he does feel patriotic about the United
States, he told me he did,&rdquo; said Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think he means to take out his naturalization
papers in the near future,&rdquo; said Mr. Carter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He tells me he feels very lonesome now that
he is in a way debarred from his own country,&rdquo;
sighed Mrs. Carter. &ldquo;That book he wrote has
made the Kaiser very angry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, after the war is over that book will
raise him in the estimation of all democracies,&rdquo;
suggested Douglas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mag says that Billy wrote to Brentano&rsquo;s to
try and get him that book and they say they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
can&rsquo;t find it; never heard of it,&rdquo; blurted out
Lucy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has perhaps not been translated into English,&rdquo;
said Helen loftily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mag says that that&rsquo;s no matter. Brentano
will get you any old book in any old language if
it is in existence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can they when a book has been suppressed?
I reckon the Kaiser is about as efficient
about suppressing as he is about everything
else. Well, book or no book, I&rsquo;m glad to be going
to a ball. He says we must ask our friends
from Richmond and he is going to invite everybody
in the county and have a great big splendid
affair, music from Richmond, and supper, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kin I go?&rdquo; asked Bobby, curling up in
Helen&rsquo;s lap, a way he had of doing when there
was no company to see him and sleep was getting
the better of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you can, if you take a good nap in
the daytime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Daddy and Mumsy, you will go, surely,&rdquo;
said Douglas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, if your mother wants to! I&rsquo;m
not much of a dancer these days, but I bet she
can outdance any of you girls. Eh, Mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not as delicate as I am now; but of course I
shall go to the ball to chaperone my girls,&rdquo; said
the little lady plaintively. &ldquo;I doubt my dancing,
however.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He says we must ask Dr. Wright and
Lewis and any other people we want. He
says he is really giving this ball to us because
we have been so hospitable to him,&rdquo; continued
Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t been any nicer to him than Miss
Ella and Miss Louise,&rdquo; said Lucy, who seemed
bent on obstructing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they are too old to have balls given to
them,&rdquo; laughed Helen. &ldquo;They are going,
though. I went to see them this afternoon with
Count de Lestis and they are just as much interested
as I am. They asked the privilege of
making the cakes for the supper and he was so
tactful that he did not tell them he was to have a
grand caterer to do the whole thing. The old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
ladies just love to do it, and one is to make angel&rsquo;s
food and one devil&rsquo;s food.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Suttons are going,&rdquo; and Helen held the
floor without interruptions because of the subject
that was interesting to all the family. &ldquo;Mr.
Sutton says if the roads permit he will send his
big car to take our whole family, and if the roads
are too bum he will have the carriage out for
Mrs. Sutton and Mumsy, and all of us can go in
the hay wagon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grand! I hope the roads will be muddy up
to the hubs!&rdquo; cried Lucy. &ldquo;Hay wagons are
lots more fun than automobiles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hard on one&rsquo;s clothes, though,&rdquo; and Helen
looked a little rueful. The question of dress
was important when one had nothing but old last
year&rsquo;s things that were so much too narrow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to wear to the ball?&rdquo;
asked Douglas that night when she and Helen
were snuggling down in their bed in the little
room up under the roof.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t anything but my rose chiffon. It
is pretty faded looking and hopelessly out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
style, but I am going to try to freshen it up a bit.
Ah me! I don&rsquo;t mind working, but I do wish I
were not an unproductive consumer. I&rsquo;d like to
make some money myself and sometimes buy
something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Douglas patted her sister consolingly. &ldquo;Poor
old Helen! I do feel so bad about you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you needn&rsquo;t! But I did see such a
love of a dancing frock when we were down town
that day with Cousin Elizabeth: white tulle over
a silver cloth with silver girdle and trimmings.
It was awfully simple but so effective. I could
just see myself in it. I ought to be ashamed to
let clothes make so much difference with me, but
I can&rsquo;t help it. I am better about it than I was
at first, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you are splendid and I also think
you have the hardest job of all to do: working all
the time and never making any money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next morning Douglas held a whispered
conversation with Nan before they got off to
their respective schools.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See what it costs but don&rsquo;t let Helen know.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
She will be eighteen tomorrow, and if it isn&rsquo;t
worth a million, I am going to take some of my
last month&rsquo;s salary and get it for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Nan, who was not much of a shopper,
approached the great windows of Richmond&rsquo;s
leading department store, what was her joy to
see the very gown that Douglas had described to
her displayed on Broad Street and marked down
to a sum in the reach of a district school teacher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks so like Helen, somehow, that I can
almost see her wearing it in place of the wax
dummy,&rdquo; exclaimed Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Must I charge it, Miss Carter?&rdquo; asked the
pleasant saleswoman as she took the precious
dress out of the show-window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, Miss Luly, somehow I&rsquo;d rather not
charge it, but I haven&rsquo;t the money today.
Couldn&rsquo;t you fix it up somehow so I could take
it with me and bring you the money tomorrow?
We don&rsquo;t charge any more, but if I don&rsquo;t buy it
right now I&rsquo;m so afraid somebody else might
get it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The smiling saleswoman, who had been waiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
on the Carters ever since the pretty Annette
Sevier came a bride to Richmond, held a conference
with the head of the firm on how this could
be managed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Nan Carter is very anxious not to
charge, but can&rsquo;t pay until tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ummm! A little irregular! What Carter
is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Robert Carter&rsquo;s daughter!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let her have it and anything else she wants
on any terms she wishes. Robert Carter&rsquo;s name
on a firm&rsquo;s books is the same as money in the
bank. I have wondered why his account has
been withdrawn from our store,&rdquo; and the head
of the firm immediately dictated a letter to his
former patron, requesting in polite terms that he
should run up as big a bill as he wished and that
he could pay whenever he got ready. So very
polite was the letter that one almost gathered he
need not pay at all.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter laughed aloud when he read the
letter, remembering those days not yet a year
gone by when the bills used to pile in on the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
of every month and he would feel that they must
be paid immediately and the only way to do it
was redouble his energy and work far into the
night.</p>

<p>The flat box with the precious dancing dress
was not an easy thing to carry on stilts, but the
lane was muddy and Nan had to do it somehow.
With much juggling she got safely over the
dangers of the road and smuggled it into the
house without Helen&rsquo;s seeing it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got it!&rdquo; Nan whispered to Douglas when
she could get her alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t have the money! I asked
you to find out the price first,&rdquo; said Douglas,
fearing Nan, in her zeal, had overstepped the
limit in price. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want anything charged.
I am so afraid we might get started to doing it
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never! I just kind of borrowed it until tomorrow.
You see I struck a sale and they
couldn&rsquo;t save it for me because there were only
a few of them. I told them I couldn&rsquo;t charge
but would bring the money tomorrow, and Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Luly fixed it up for me, somehow, and told me
I could have the whole department store on any
terms I saw fit to dictate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morning dawned on Helen&rsquo;s eighteenth birthday
but found her in not very jubilant spirits.
It isn&rsquo;t much fun to have an eighteenth birthday
when you have to bounce out of bed and rush
into your clothes to see that a poor ignorant
country servant doesn&rsquo;t make the toast and
scramble the eggs before she even puts a kettle
of water on for coffee. Chloe always progressed
backwards unless Helen was there to do the head
work.</p>

<p>Helen found Chloe had already descended her
perilous ladder and had the stove hot and the
kettle on as a birthday present to her beloved
mistress. Chloe really adored Helen and did
her best to learn and remember. The breakfast
table was set, too, and Chloe&rsquo;s eyes were shining
as though she had something to say but wild
horses would not make her say it.</p>

<p>The sisters came in at the first tap of the bell
and her father was in his place, too. Helen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
started to seat herself at her accustomed place,
but at a shout from Lucy looked before she sat.
Her chair was piled high with parcels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Happy birthday, honey!&rdquo; said Douglas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Happy birthday, daughter!&rdquo; from Mr. Carter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Happy birthday! Happy birthday!&rdquo;
shouted all of them in chorus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I didn&rsquo;t know anybody remembered!&rdquo;
cried Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not remember your eighteenth birthday!
Well, rather!&rdquo; said Mr. Carter.</p>

<p>Then began the opening of the boxes while
Chloe stood in the corner grinning for dear life.</p>

<p>A pearl pin from Mrs. Carter, one she had
worn when she first met her husband, was in the
small box on top. An old-fashioned filigree
gold bracelet was Mr. Carter&rsquo;s gift. It had belonged
to his mother, for whom Helen was
named.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will look very lovely on your arm, my
dear,&rdquo; he said when Helen kissed him in thanks.</p>

<p>Cousin Elizabeth Somerville had sent her ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
dollars in gold; Lewis, some new gloves; there
was a vanity box from Lucy with a saucy message
about always powdering her nose; a little
thread lace collar from Nan, made by her own
hands; and to balance all was a five-pound box
of candy from Dr. Wright.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had a big marble for you, but it done slipt
out&rsquo;n my pocket,&rdquo; said Bobby, and then he had
to give a big hug and a kiss, which Helen declared
was better than even a marble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t opened your big box, the
one at the bottom,&rdquo; insisted Nan. It had got
covered up with papers and Helen had overlooked
it. &ldquo;Please hurry up and open it because
Lucy and I have to beat it. It will be
train time before we know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Helen untied the strings and unwrapped
the tissue paper that was packed around the contents
of the big box you could have heard a pin
drop in that dining-room at Valhalla. She eagerly
pulled aside the papers and then shook
out the glimmering gown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Douglas! Douglas! You shouldn&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
have done it! It is even prettier than I remembered
it to be!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mind out, don&rsquo;t splash on it,&rdquo; warned Nan
just in time to keep the two great tears that
welled up into Helen&rsquo;s eyes from spotting the
exquisite creation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Miss Helen&rsquo;s gwinter look like a angel
whin she goes ter de count&rsquo;s jamboree,&rdquo; declared
Chloe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, your Miss Douglas is the angel and
she&rsquo;s going to have to have a new dress with slits
in the shoulder-blades to let her wings come
through,&rdquo; sobbed Helen, laughing at the same
time as she held the dress up in front of her and
danced around the table. She had thought nobody
remembered her eighteenth birthday and
now found nobody had forgotten it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have afforded it, Douglas. I
can&rsquo;t keep it. It would be too selfish of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marked down goods not sent on approval,&rdquo;
drawled Nan.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />

<span class="f8">BLACK SOCIALISM</span></h2>


<p>Sergeant Somerville and Private Tinsley
accepted the invitation to the count&rsquo;s ball with
alacrity. Their company had been mustered
out just in the nick of time for them to obtain indefinite
leave. It was rumored that they were
to be taken in again, this time as regulars, but
the certainty of having no military duties to perform
for the time being was very pleasant to our
two young men.</p>

<p>The Carter girls had taken the count at his
word and invited several friends from Richmond
to stay at Valhalla and attend the ball. Dr.
Wright was eager to come and with the recklessness
of physicians who use their cars for business
and not for pleasure, he made the trip in his automobile.
He had a new five-seated car, taking
the place of his former runabout.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;M.&nbsp;D.&rsquo;s and R.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;D.&rsquo;s have to travel
whether roads are good or bad,&rdquo; he had declared.</p>

<p>The two young soldiers and Tillie Wingo had
the hardihood to risk their necks with him, and at
the last minute he picked up Skeeter Halsey and
Frank Maury, who had been invited by Lucy so
that she and Mag would not have to be wall
flowers. Six persons in a five-passenger car insures
them from much jolting, as there is no
room to bounce.</p>

<p>Tillie was in her element with five pairs of
masculine ears to chatter in. She and Bill were
still engaged &ldquo;in a way,&rdquo; as she expressed it,
although neither one of them seemed to regard it
very seriously. Tillie insisted upon making a
secret of it as much as she was capable, so that in
Bill&rsquo;s absence she might not be laid on the shelf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fellows don&rsquo;t think much of an engaged
girl,&rdquo; she said frankly, &ldquo;and I have no idea of
taking a back seat yet awhile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The recklessness of the guests in coming over
Virginia roads in an automobile in the month of
February was nothing to the recklessness of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
Carters in inviting six persons to spend the night
with them when they possessed but one small
guest chamber.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can manage somehow,&rdquo; Helen declared,
&ldquo;and, besides, we will be out so late dancing
there won&rsquo;t be much use in having a place to
sleep, because we won&rsquo;t have any time to sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only think of all of those bedrooms at
Grantly with nobody in them!&rdquo; exclaimed Lucy.
&ldquo;Those old ladies might just as well ask some of
us up there, but they will never think of it, I
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they do, they will disagree about which
ones to ask and which rooms to put them in, and
we will never get the invitation,&rdquo; laughed Helen.
&ldquo;Anyhow, they are dear old ladies and I am
mighty fond of them.&rdquo; Helen often ran up to
the great house to ask advice from the Misses
Grant about household affairs and was ever welcome
to the lonely old women.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are certainly going to the ball, aren&rsquo;t
they?&rdquo; asked Douglas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t miss it for worlds. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
are having a time just now, though, because
Tempy has left them. They can&rsquo;t find out what
her reason is and feel sure she didn&rsquo;t really want
to go; now her sister Chloe is so near she seemed
quite content, but for weeks she has been in a
peculiar frame of mind and the last few days
they have caught her in tears again and again.
They sent for Dr. Allison, who lives miles and
miles from here, but Miss Ella and Miss Louise
will trust no other doctor. He says as far as he
can tell she is not ill. Anyhow, she has gone
home, and today their man-servant departed,
also. Of course they might draw on the field
hands for servants, but they hate to do it because
they are so very rough. They have had this
man-servant for years and years, ever since he
was a little boy, and they can&rsquo;t account for his
going, either. He had a face as long as a ham
when he left them and gave absolutely no excuse
except that his maw was sick, and as Miss Ella
says, &lsquo;His mother has been dead for ten years,
and she ought to know, since she furnished the
clothes in which she was buried.&rsquo; Miss Louise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
said she had only been dead eight, and they were
her clothes, but they agree that she is dead at
least, and can&rsquo;t account for Sam&rsquo;s excuse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor old ladies, I am sorry for them,&rdquo; said
Douglas.</p>

<p>On the day of the ball, there was much
furbishing up of finery at Valhalla. Mr. Carter&rsquo;s
dress suit had to be pressed and his seldom
used dress studs unearthed. Mrs. Carter
forgot all about being an invalid and was as busy
and happy as possible, trying dresses on her
daughters to see that their underskirts were exactly
the right length and even running tucks in
with her own helpless little hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a good thing I don&rsquo;t have to think about
my own outsides,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;as all of my time
must be spent in planning for our guests&rsquo; insides.
I tell you, six more mouths to fill is going
to keep Chloe and me hustling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It sho&rsquo; is an&rsquo; all them dishes ter wash is goin&rsquo;
ter keep me hustlin&rsquo; some mo&rsquo;,&rdquo; grumbled Chloe.
&ldquo;An&rsquo; then I gotter go ter the count&rsquo;s an&rsquo; stir my
stumps.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry, but I am going to give you a nice
holiday after it is all over,&rdquo; said her young mistress
kindly. The count had asked Helen to
bring Chloe to look after the ladies in the dressing-room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a-mindin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout dishes. I&rsquo;s jes&rsquo;
a-foolin&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash; Say, Miss Helen, what does potatriotic
mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Patriotic? That means loving your country
and being willing to give up things for it and
help save it. Everybody should be patriotic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But s&rsquo;posin&rsquo; yer ain&rsquo;t got no country?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Chloe, everybody has a country, either
the place where you were born or the place where
you have been living long enough to love and
feel that it is yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But niggers is been livin&rsquo; here foreveraneveramen,
an&rsquo; still they ain&rsquo;t ter say got no country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you have! Don&rsquo;t you think Uncle
Sam would look after you and fight for you if
you needed his help?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got no Uncle Sam, but I hear tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
that he wouldn&rsquo;t raise his han&rsquo; ter save a nigger,
but yit if&rsquo;n they&rsquo;s a war that he&rsquo;ll &rsquo;spec&rsquo; the niggers
ter go git shot up fer him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Chloe! How can you say such a
thing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t er sayin&rsquo; it&mdash;I&rsquo;s jes&rsquo; a-sayin&rsquo; I hears
tell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who told it to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody ain&rsquo;t tol&rsquo; it ter me. I jes&rsquo; hearn it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s not true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hearn, too, that they&rsquo;s plenty er money ter
go &rsquo;roun&rsquo; in this country, but some folks what
thinks they&rsquo;s better&rsquo;n other folks has hoarded an&rsquo;
hoarded &rsquo;til po&rsquo; folks can&rsquo;t git they han&rsquo;s on a
nickel. An&rsquo; I hearn that they&rsquo;s gonter be distress
an&rsquo; misery, an&rsquo; wailin&rsquo; an&rsquo; snatchin&rsquo; er teeth
&rsquo;til some strong man arouses an&rsquo; makes these
here rich folks gib up they tin. Nobody ain&rsquo;t
a-gonter know who dat leader will be, he mought
be white an&rsquo; thin agin he mought be black, but
he&rsquo;s a-gonter be a kinder sabior.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is he going to manage?&rdquo; asked Helen,
amused at what sounded like a sermon the girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
might have heard from the rickety pulpit of the
brick church.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t hearn, but I done gib out ter all these
niggers that my white folks ain&rsquo;t got no tin put
away here in this Hogwallow or whatever Miss
Nan done named it. They keeps their money
hot a-spendin&rsquo; it, I tells &rsquo;em all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen laughed, and with a final touch at the
supper table and a last peep at the sally lunn
muffins, which were rising as they should, she
started to go help her mother with the dancing
frocks and their petticoats that would show discrepancies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, Miss Helen, is you sho&rsquo; Miss Ellanlouise
is goin&rsquo; ternight?&rdquo; asked Chloe, following
her up the steps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Chloe, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo;, Miss Helen, if&rsquo;n folks ain&rsquo;t got no
country ter love what ought they do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, love one another, I reckon. Love the
people of their own race, and try to help them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oughtn&rsquo;t folks ter love they own color better&rsquo;n
any other?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, certainly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If&rsquo;n some of yo&rsquo; folks got into trouble, what
would you do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;d help them out if I could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even if&rsquo;n they done wrong?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course! They would still be my own
people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they ain&rsquo;t ter say done it but is a-gonter
do it, thin what would you do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d try to stop them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you tell on &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d try to stop them first. Who has done
wrong or is going to do it, Chloe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody ain&rsquo;t done wrong an&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t a-never
said they is. I ain&rsquo;t said a word. This talk was
jes&rsquo; some foolishness I done made up out&rsquo;n my
haid. But say, Miss Helen,&mdash;I&rsquo;d kinder like ter
stop at Mammy&rsquo;s cabin over to Paradise befo&rsquo; I
gits ter de count&rsquo;s. I kin take my foot in my
han&rsquo; an&rsquo; strike through the woods an&rsquo; beat the
hay wagin thar, it goin&rsquo; roun&rsquo; by the road.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Chloe!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen rather fancied that Chloe wanted to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
her sister, who was evidently contemplating
some imprudence. She had been threatening to
marry James Hanks, but her people had shown
themselves very much opposed to it. Perhaps
the girl was on the eve of an elopement which
had called forth all of the above conversation
from her sister. Where did she get all of those
strange socialistic ideas? Was Lewis Somerville
right and was the little learning a dangerous
thing for these poor colored people? Surely
she had helped Chloe by the little teaching she
had given her. The girl was like another creature.
She seemed now to have self-respect, and
Helen felt instinctively that her loyalty to her
and her family was almost a religion with her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />

<span class="f8">DRESSING FOR THE BALL</span></h2>


<p>&ldquo;How are Miss Ella and Louise going?&rdquo;
asked Douglas, as she stooped for a parting
glance in the mirror which the sloping ceiling
necessitated hanging so low that a girl as tall as
Douglas could not see above her nose without
bending double.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In their phaeton,&rdquo; answered Helen. &ldquo;They
don&rsquo;t mind driving themselves. I asked them.
You see with Sam gone they can&rsquo;t get out the
big old rockaway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They must keep along near the hay wagon.
Such old ladies should not be alone on the road,&rdquo;
said Douglas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare you to tell them that! They have no
fear of anything or anybody. They say they
have lived alone in this county for so many,
many years that they are sure nobody will ever
harm them.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I am sure nobody ever would,&rdquo; said
Nan.</p>

<p>The girls had decided that the only way to
take care of so many guests was to double up
&ldquo;in layers,&rdquo; as Lucy called it. Bobby was sent
over into the new house with Lewis and Bill, his
old tent mates, for whom Nan and Lucy had vacated
their room while they came over to the old
house and brought Tillie Wingo with them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three in a double bed and two in a single
bed wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad after a ball,&rdquo; Nan had
declared.</p>

<p>Dressing for the ball was the more difficult
feat, however. The ceiling was so low and sloping
and Tillie Wingo did take up so much room
with her fluffy ruffles. The Carter girls were
glad to see the voluble Tillie. She was such a
gay, good-natured person and seemed so pleased
to be included in this pleasure party. She looked
as pretty as a pink in a much beruffled painted
chiffon; and while they were dressing, she obligingly
showed Helen the very latest steps in
dancing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>Helen was charming in her birthday present
dress. Nan declared she looked like the princess
in the fairy tale with the dress like the moonlight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With all my finery, I don&rsquo;t look nearly so
well as you do, Douglas,&rdquo; Helen declared.</p>

<p>Indeed Douglas was beautiful. She had on
the graduating dress, the price of which had
caused her so much concern the spring before.
With careful ripping out of sleeves and snipping
down of neck, Mrs. Carter had converted it into
an evening dress with the help of a wonderful
lace fichu, something left over from her own
former splendor.</p>

<p>The sight of her eldest daughter all dressed
in the ball gown brought tears of regret to poor
Mrs. Carter&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a débutante you would have made!&rdquo;
she sighed. &ldquo;You have a queenly something
about you that is quite rare in a débutante and
might have made the hit of the season.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mumsy, I&rsquo;m a much better district
school teacher!&rdquo; and Douglas blushed with
pleasure at her mother&rsquo;s rare praise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl had seen a subtle difference in her
mother&rsquo;s manner to her ever since she had felt it
her duty to take a stand about their affairs. Mrs.
Carter was ever gentle, ever courteous, but
Douglas knew that she looked upon her no
longer as her daughter somehow,&mdash;rather as a
kind of taskmistress that Fate had set over her.</p>

<p>The young men were gathered in the living-room
waiting for the girls and when they burst
upon them in all the glory of ball gowns they
quite dazzled them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Douglas!&rdquo; gasped Lewis in an ill-concealed
whisper, &ldquo;you somehow make me think of an
Easter lily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t feel like one a bit. I can&rsquo;t
fancy an Easter lily&rsquo;s dancing, and I mean to
dance every dance I get a chance and all the
others, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon I can promise you that,&rdquo; grinned
her cousin.</p>

<p>Bill Tinsley made no ado of taking the pretty
Tillie in his arms and opening the ball with a
whistled fox trot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get the first dance with you,
and to make sure I&rsquo;ll just take it now, please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like my dress?&rdquo; asked Helen,
twirling around on her toe before Dr. Wright,
whose eyes plainly showed that he not only liked
the dress but what was in the dress rather more
than was good for the peace of mind of a rising
young nerve specialist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lovely!&rdquo; he exclaimed, not looking at the
dress at all, but at the charming face above the
dress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Douglas gave it to me for a birthday present,&mdash;it
was her extravagance, not mine. I
think she is about the sweetest thing in all the
world. The only thing that worries me is mashing
it all up in the Suttons&rsquo; hay wagon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are the roads so very bad? Why not go in
my car?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are pretty bad, but no worse than the
road from Richmond. It certainly is strange
how that road changes. It was fine when the
agent brought us out here to see the place.
Wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It was, but I don&rsquo;t think it is such a very bad
road now. It may be because I like to travel on
it. But come on and go with me in my car. If
you will trust your dress and neck to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will, since you put my dress first! Somehow
that makes me feel you will be careful of it
and respect it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A rattle of wheels and Billy Sutton came
driving up in a great hay wagon filled with nice,
clean straw, and close on his heels were Mr. and
Mrs. Sutton in their carriage, which was to take
Mr. and Mrs. Carter sedately to the ball.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Helen and I are going in my car. Does
anyone want to occupy the back seat?&rdquo; asked
George Wright, hoping he would be paid for his
politeness by a refusal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No indeed, I adore a hay wagon! It&rsquo;s so
nice and informal,&rdquo; cried Tillie.</p>

<p>Douglas did want to go, but felt perhaps it
was up to her to chaperone the youngsters in the
hay wagon, so for once Dr. Wright thought he
was to get Helen for a few moments to himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chloe must go with us,&rdquo; declared Helen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
&ldquo;She wants to stop in Paradise to see her
mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Wright cracked a grim joke to himself
which concerned Chloe and the antipodes of
Paradise, but he smothered his feelings and
opened the door for the delighted colored girl,
who had never been in an automobile before.</p>

<p>What a gay crowd they were in that hay
wagon! Billy Sutton had contrived to get Nan
on the front seat with him, where she was enthroned
high above the others, looking down on
the horses&rsquo; backs as they strained and pulled the
great wagon through the half-frozen mud.
Billy had some friends out from town who immediately
attached themselves to Tillie Wingo,
who was to beaux just as a honey-pot to bees.
They stopped and picked up two families of
young folks on the way to the count&rsquo;s, and by the
time they got them all in, the wagon was quite
full.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad Helen didn&rsquo;t trust her new dress
to this,&rdquo; Douglas whispered to Lewis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I am glad you didn&rsquo;t have on such fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
clothes and came this way,&rdquo; he whispered back.
&ldquo;Wright is too reckless for me on these country
roads. Not that I am afraid myself, but I certainly
should hate to see you turned over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whar Miss Ellanlouise?&rdquo; asked Chloe,
when she could get her breath after the first mad
plunge into the delights of motoring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, there! How selfish of me! I should
have thought of it and asked them to go with
us,&rdquo; said Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can go back for them,&rdquo; suggested the
doctor, who had begun to feel that he never
would have a chance to see Helen alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, we needn&rsquo;t mind. They are coming
in their phaeton, and no doubt have started long
before this. They are so good to me, I should
have thought of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chloe was put out at Paradise, assuring her
mistress she would come up through the woods in
a few moments and no doubt be at her post in
the dressing-room before the guests should arrive.</p>

<p>Paradise was very dark and lonesome. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
few scattered cabins showed not a gleam. There
was a dim light trickling from the windows of
the club, but as they approached that rickety
building, that disappeared. Helen saw some
dark forms up close to the wall when she looked
back after passing that place of entertainment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon they are going to initiate someone
tonight,&rdquo; she thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chloe had such a strange talk with me today,&rdquo;
she told her companion and then repeated
the conversation she had had with the colored
girl. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t quite understand her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps this count is instilling some kind of
silly socialistic notions in their heads,&rdquo; suggested
the doctor, who held the same opinion Lewis
Somerville did of the gentleman who was to be
their host for the evening. Indeed, he so cordially
mistrusted him that only the fact he was to
be with Helen had reconciled him to spending an
evening under his roof.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, I can hardly think that, and besides,
the count does not do the teaching. That is done
by a Mr. Herz, his secretary. He is an American,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
born in Cincinnati. He seems to be very
intelligent and certainly has taken a shine to
Douglas. I don&rsquo;t know just what she thinks of
him, but she lets him walk home from school with
her every now and then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the name much!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, the poor man can&rsquo;t help his name.
You speak as though we were already at war
with Germany. I am trying to preserve our
neutrality until war is declared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My neutrality has been nothing but a farce
since I have realized that Germany is at war
with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You sound just like Douglas and Father.
Will you go to war if it comes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course! Would you have me do
otherwise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; and Helen wished she
had not asked the question that had called forth
this query. This night was to be one of pleasure,
feasting and dancing. War had no place in her
thoughts when she had on her new dress and the
music was coming from Richmond.</p>

<hr class="l1" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />

<span class="f8">THE BALL</span></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Music and lights put me all in a flutter!&rdquo;
exclaimed Helen as they approached the broad
and hospitable mansion.</p>

<p>Already there were several buggies and carriages
in the gravelled driveway. The guests
were arriving early, as sensible country people
should. Let the city folks wait until far in the
night to begin their revels, but those living in the
country as a rule feel that balls should start early
and break up early.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you care so much for parties?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I must. I have not been to very
many balls, because you see I am not out in society
yet. I reckon I&rsquo;ll never make my début
now,&rdquo; and Helen gave a little sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does it make so very much difference to
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, not so much as it would have a year
ago. I used to feel that making one&rsquo;s début was
a goal that was of the utmost importance, but
somehow now I do feel that there are things a
little bit more worth while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What for instance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Getting Father well, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might think I am silly if I tell you,&mdash;silly
to talk about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promise to think you are you no matter
what else it is, and you are&mdash;well, never mind
what you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, somehow I have begun to feel that
helping people to be gay is important, like cheering
up Miss Ella and Miss Louise. They have
such stupid times. I really believe they quarrel
just to make life a little gayer. I go to see them
every day and it makes me feel good all over to
know how much they like to have me come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you were afraid I&rsquo;d think that was
silly?&rdquo; asked George Wright as he halted his car
down under a great willow oak, well away from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
the other vehicles. How he wished they were to
stay out under that tree all evening! Music and
dancing were nothing to him compared to the
pleasure he obtained from talking to this girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s sit here until the others come,&rdquo; he suggested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And waste all that good music!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Wright began to envy the Misses Grant
whom Helen wanted to make happy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not! I forgot how seldom you
have a chance to dance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Weston was wonderfully beautiful. The
electric lights may have been an anomaly, but
they certainly helped to make the old house show
what it was capable of. The dead and gone
colonials who had built the place had been forced
either to have their balls by daylight or to content
themselves with flickering candles, which no
doubt dropped wax or even tallow on the handsome
gowns of the beauties and belles. The
broad hall with the great rooms on each side
seemed to be made for dancing. The floor was
polished to a dangerous point for the unwary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
but the unwary had no business on a ballroom
floor.</p>

<p>The count seemed in his element as he received
his guests, but Herz looked thoroughly out of
place and ill at ease.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Miss Helen! I am so glad to welcome
you&mdash;and Dr. Wright&mdash;it is indeed kind of you
to come! I am depending upon you, Miss
Helen, to help me entertain these people who
have come so promptly. They neither dance nor
speak. Herz is about as much use to me on this
occasion as a porcupine would be. Only look
around the room at my guests!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They did indeed look most forlorn. One old
farmer was almost asleep while his wife sat bolt
upright by his side with a long sad face and a
deep regret in her eyes. No doubt, she was regretting
the comfortable grey wrapper she had
discarded for the stiff, best, green silk, and the
broad easy slippers that had been replaced by
the creaking shoes. Several girls with shining
eyes and alert expressions were evidently wondering
what ailed the young men who stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
against the wall as though it might fall down if
they budged an inch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are they wasting all this good music?&rdquo;
demanded Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you say in America: &lsquo;Seek me!&rsquo;&rdquo;
laughed the host.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Search me, you mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, but is it not almost the same? What do
you say, Dr. Wright?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d rather someone would seek me
than search me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So! And now, Miss Helen, if you will discard
your wraps and return quickly and help
me I shall be most grateful. If these poor people
do not get started they will go to sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen flew up to the dressing-room which,
sure enough, Chloe had reached before her. The
girl was huddled down in a corner of the room
looking the picture of woe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see Tempy?&rdquo; asked Helen, taking
for granted that Chloe had been speaking of her
sister when she had asked about one&rsquo;s duty to
one&rsquo;s own people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No&rsquo;m!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t she at your mother&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, &rsquo;m!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was your mother there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yassum!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was never any use in trying to make
Chloe talk when she had decided not to, so Helen
threw off her wraps and with a peep in the mirror
where one could see from top to toe, she hastened
to the aid of Count de Lestis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother will be along soon and she can do
wonders with people who are bashful,&rdquo; declared
Helen, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll try my hand at it until she comes.
They must dance, then they will thaw out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, and will you dance with me to
show them how?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen forgot all about the fact that she had
come with Dr. Wright and he might reasonably
expect to claim the first dance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you must introduce me to all these
people and I&rsquo;ll ask some of the girls to dance
while you go get the young men to come fall in
the breach.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>The shiny-eyed girls were willing enough and
the young men seemed to think if the count
didn&rsquo;t mind his walls falling down, far be it from
them to hold them up, so in a few moments the
sad crowd were in a gale of good humor. The
old farmer waked up and his wife looked as
though she might try her new creaky shoes on
the waxed floor if anyone would only ask her.</p>

<p>Dr. Wright looked on rather grimly as Helen
was whisked from under his very nose. He
might have stood it better if the count had not
been such a perfect dancer and so very handsome.
He had a way of whispering to his partner
during the dance that was also a sore trial to
the young physician.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What could he be saying to Helen to make
her dimple and blush?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The arrival of the carriage containing Mrs.
Sutton and Mrs. Carter with their rather bored
husbands was a welcome interruption to the poor
young man. Soon came the lumbering hay
wagon with its giggling, chattering load, and
then Helen was at liberty to dance with him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
since the count perforce must again play the
gracious host.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it perfect?&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;The
floor, the music, and everything!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not quite so perfect now as when you had
the count for a partner, I am afraid,&rdquo; he muttered,
bending over to make her hear. He was
too tall to converse while dancing with Helen.
He had never regretted his inches before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! You dance just as well as he
does, and he talks so much while he is dancing.
I hate to dance and talk, too,&mdash;just dancing is
enough for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me, too, then!&rdquo; and once more he felt the
satisfaction that a man who measures over six
feet can&rsquo;t help feeling.</p>

<p>Helen was right. Mrs. Carter was a born entertainer
and she had hardly taken the social
reins in her hands before the ball was running
smoothly. Even Bobby found a partner, a
funny little girl with such bushy hair that anyone
could tell at a glance it had been put up in
curl papers for several days. She looked like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
pink hollyhock in her starched book-muslin that
stood out like a paper lamp shade. Her round
black eyes seemed very lovely to the gallant
Bobby, who took her into the back hall where
they turned round and round in imitation of the
dance, and when dancing palled on them they
showed each other how to make rabbits out of
their handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the kind of party I like,&rdquo; said the
wholesome Mrs. Sutton. &ldquo;Every Jill has her
Jack and there are some Jacks to spare. Deliver
me from parties where girls must sit against
the wall and wait for partners to be released.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you get the vote you can do the asking,
and then parties where the females predominate
will be more popular,&rdquo; teased her husband.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! We can still do the asking if we
care to. Come on and dance with me, sir!&rdquo; and
Mr. Sutton delightedly complied.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter did not have to spend all the evening
making other people have a good time. She
was asked to dance by the count and her pretty
little figure and graceful bearing attracted other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
partners, and she was soon tripping the light
fantastic toe as untiringly as any of her daughters.
Tillie Wingo herself did not get broken
in on oftener.</p>

<p>Herz stood in corners, looking like one of the
men out of Noah&rsquo;s ark, Nan declared, so stiff
and wooden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know which one he resembles most,
Shem, Ham, or Japheth,&rdquo; she whispered to Billy
Sutton, &ldquo;but I wonder if you licked him if the
paint would come off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I&rsquo;d like to try. I can&rsquo;t
abide that Dutchman. I believe he thinks he is
superior to all of us, even his precious count.
Jehoshaphat! I believe he is asking Douglas to
dance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he was. The secretary was stalking across
the room, determination on his noble brow and
his full mouth drawn together in a tight red line.
He stopped in front of Douglas and placing one
hand on his breast and the other one on his waist
line in the back, he shut up like a jack-knife.</p>

<p>Douglas looked a little astonished, not knowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
exactly what the young man wanted, and
then the memory of the early days at dancing
school came to her when the little boys were
forced to bow to the little girls before they
danced with them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; she said, excusing herself from
Lewis, who looked a little sullen, having expected
to claim this particular waltz with his
cousin, but who had neglected to do so, being too
intent on gazing at her pretty flushed face.</p>

<p>Herz clasped her around the waist and began
to twirl in a most astonishing manner. She
could hardly keep her footing and very early lost
her breath. Skilful guiding was not necessary,
although when they arose to dance the floor was
well filled with other couples, but these, knowing
full well that discretion was the better part of
valor, gave the spinning pair the right of way.
The man never lost his gravity or dignity, but
his mouth broke from the hard red line to its usual
full-lipped curve. Douglas felt as though that
dance would never end. His strong arm held her
like an iron ring as round and round they went.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&ldquo;&lsquo;Hi! Lee! Hi! Low!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hi! Lee! Hi! Low!<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>sang Billy Sutton, as he and Nan watched the
gyrations of their host&rsquo;s secretary. &ldquo;Did you
ever see such a proof of foreign blood in any
man who pretends to be American born?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Billy, he is American born. The
count says he was born and raised in Cincinnati.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and the count says he himself was born
and raised in Hungary, but I bet you anything
they may have been born where they say they
were but they were raised in Berlin. Look at
that fellow and tell me if he doesn&rsquo;t dance like
Old Heidelberg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The count doesn&rsquo;t, anyhow. I never saw
such divine dancing as the count&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As though he had heard her, the handsome
smiling de Lestis came to claim her for the rest
of the dance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t these foreigners the limit?&rdquo; said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
boy, seeking the disconsolate Lewis. &ldquo;I know
I oughtn&rsquo;t to say anything about a fellow when
I am in his house, but somehow that count gets
my goat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mine, too! Who is this Herz?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he is a kind of lady&rsquo;s maid or secretary
or something for his nibs. Says he is an American,
but I have my doubts. I don&rsquo;t see how Miss
Douglas Carter can stand for him, but she lets
him walk home from school with her any time,
so I hear,&rdquo; announced Billy, absolutely unconscious
of the fact he was retailing very unwelcome
news to his companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; was all Lewis could say, but that
monosyllable had a world of meaning in it. And
so although the music was gay and the lights
were bright and the laughter was merry in that
ballroom, there were several sore hearts, and the
little green-eyed monster was waltzing or fox
trotting or one stepping every dance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder why Miss Ella and Louise don&rsquo;t
get here,&rdquo; Helen said to Dr. Wright, who had at
last persuaded her to sit out one dance with him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
&ldquo;They have had plenty of time even with their
slow old horse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had found a sofa in the back hall behind
a clump of palms. There were many plants artistically
grouped by the florist from town, who
had tastefully decorated the whole mansion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The telephone has been ringing a great deal
since we came. Could they be trying to get the
count? I always feel like jumping when the
&rsquo;phone rings, feeling that it must be for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! The ring for Weston is two long
and three short rings. These country &rsquo;phones
are hard to learn, but I often answer the one at
Grantly for my old friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen, there goes the bell again! Goodness!
I believe one of these &rsquo;phones that rings everybody&rsquo;s
number would send me crazy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They say you get used to them. That is
four shorts and a long. That&rsquo;s for Dr. Allison,
who lives miles and miles from here. Don&rsquo;t you
remember Page Allison, that lovely girl who
came to Greendale with the Tucker twins? It
is her father.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I do, and I know Dr. Allison,
too! A delightful gentleman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;ll call up Miss Ella and see what
is the matter,&mdash;why they don&rsquo;t come on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>George Wright sighed. There always seemed
to be something to keep Helen from talking to
him tête-à-tête. Still, he felt glad to think that
Helen was so fond of these old ladies and so
thoughtful of them.</p>

<p>The telephone was under the stairway, quite
near their retired nook. Helen rang the number
for Grantly and there was a quick response.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; came in Miss Louise&rsquo;s contralto
notes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Louise, this is Helen Carter! Why
haven&rsquo;t you started yet? Don&rsquo;t you know the
count can&rsquo;t give a ball without you and Miss
Ella?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear, my sister is ill, very ill,&mdash;fainted
just as we were getting ready to leave.
You see she would make that cake, that angel&rsquo;s
food, although I told her I was going to make a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>fruit cake, but you know Ella&mdash;&mdash; Oh, but how
can I rattle along this way? I have been trying
so hard to get Dr. Allison and he doesn&rsquo;t answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, Miss Louise,&rdquo; and Helen
put her hand over the receiver and turned to Dr.
Wright.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Wright, will you take me to Grantly?
Miss Ella has had a fainting fit&mdash;a stroke, I am
afraid it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take you! My dear, I&rsquo;ll take you anywhere
you want to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Louise, Dr. Wright is going to bring
me to Grantly in his automobile immediately.
Don&rsquo;t worry; we will be there soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She rang off quickly and flew upstairs for her
wraps. Chloe was not in the dressing-room, but
she quickly unearthed her cape and hood from
the bed where the many shawls and cloaks had
been piled. On the way out she whispered to
Nan where she was going, but told her not to
tell the others, as she did not want to break up
the ball or to cast a shadow on the happiness of
the dancers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<span class="f8">ANGEL&rsquo;S FOOD</span></h2>


<p>Not a sound or glimmer of light in Paradise
as they speeded silently through the settlement!
The club, too, was deserted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you are splendid to be willing to give
up this ball to go to the aid of these old ladies,&rdquo;
said Dr. Wright, drawing the rug more closely
around Helen, as the air was quite nipping.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, the idea of my not doing it! You
must think I&rsquo;m nothing but a heartless butterfly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you are anything but one. You love
dancing, though, so much. I should have come
alone. Somehow I couldn&rsquo;t make up my mind
to forego the ride alone with you. Isn&rsquo;t it a
beautiful night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stars were shining brightly but the lazy
moon had not yet gotten up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we find the poor old lady not too ill, I&rsquo;ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
take you back to the dance after we have made
her comfortable. There will be a moon to light
our way later on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will be fine! Maybe they won&rsquo;t even
miss us. But somehow I have a feeling that
Miss Ella is very ill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Five minutes more will decide the question.
Hasn&rsquo;t my new car eaten up distance, though?
Just think, in old days what a time sick persons
had to wait for a physician without telephones
and without cars!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Allison still drives a fast horse to a light
buggy. Page says he will none of horseless carriages.
I believe it is only recently that he has
submitted to a telephone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a good thing his medical theories have
not kept pace with his means of locomotion, or he
would be a back number sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Valhalla was very quiet, peacefully sleeping
under the stars. What a haven of refuge it had
been to the Carters! Helen looked lovingly at
the picturesque roof lines as the car glided rapidly
past.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know, I think that must be the most
restful place in all the world? I have grown so
attached to the little tumbledown house, leaks
and cracks, smoking stove and all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t it been awfully hard on you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not any harder on me than on the others!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you what I think of all of you
Carter girls for the way you have grappled with
the winter in the country. I think you have had
the hot end of it, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There flashed through Helen&rsquo;s mind a picture
of the first time she saw the young doctor, in the
library of their pretty home in Richmond.
There had been no approval in his cold glance
then, nothing but censure and severity. She had
deserved it all. Did she deserve the praise he
gave her now?</p>

<p>&ldquo;The hot end is better than the cold end during
the winter months,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;At
least I can stay snugly in the kitchen and not
have to go out in all weathers like poor Douglas
and the other girls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Louise met them at the door, tears rolling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
down her fat cheeks. She still was dressed in
her stiff black silk but had tied on a great gingham
apron over her best dress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How good of you to come to us!&rdquo; was all
she could sob out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should have sent for us immediately,&rdquo;
said Helen, putting her arms around the trembling
old woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ella always wants Dr. Allison, and I hated
so to break up the pleasure of the young people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is your sister?&rdquo; asked Dr. Wright,
taking off his gloves and great coat, and extracting
a small leather case from its pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got her to bed after she came to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is conscious then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but very low, very low. She has been
so docile I am afraid she is going to die,&rdquo; and
the poor lady began to weep anew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me go in with the doctor,&rdquo; insisted
Helen. &ldquo;I can do what is necessary and you
might scare Miss Ella. She mustn&rsquo;t be made to
think she is so ill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tall form of Miss Ella was stretched on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
the great four-posted bed, and so still was it that
for a moment Helen was afraid to go near.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She might be dead! She might be dead!&rdquo;
her heart cried out, but she shut her mouth very
tight and advanced bravely up to the bedside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Ella, Dr. Wright has come to see you.
Dr. Allison will be here later on perhaps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be better in a few moments. I must
have fainted,&rdquo; she said weakly. &ldquo;I ought not to
have tried the angel food cake. It is so tedious.
Louise told me not to, but I was very headstrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen looked up apprehensively at the doctor,
who was feeling the patient&rsquo;s pulse. It did seem
rather ominous for Miss Ella to be so humble
and to confess that Louise&rsquo;s judgment was of
any importance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you eat for dinner?&rdquo; asked the
doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t remember.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon I ate some bread.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing else?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At a nod from the doctor Helen went out to
seek this information from Miss Louise, whom
she found huddled up on the hall sofa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eat for dinner! I am sure I don&rsquo;t know.
She wouldn&rsquo;t eat when I did and I do believe
she didn&rsquo;t eat anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How about supper?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we neither one of us ate any supper.
We felt it would be discourteous to the count
after all the trouble and expense he must have
gone to, with caterers from Richmond and
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen flew back to the bedside of Miss Ella.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She ate no dinner that Miss Louise can remember
and neither one of them ate any supper,&rdquo;
she cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, of course she fainted then. Can you
take the matter in hand and get some toast and
tea for both of them? Miss Louise will be toppling
over next.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen was intimate enough with the old sisters
to know just where they kept everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
and in short order she had a tray ready for poor
half-starved Miss Ella.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was not a stroke at all,&rdquo; Dr. Wright assured
the anxious sister. &ldquo;Nothing but hunger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told her to eat,&rdquo; and Miss Louise looked
venomously at the invalid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came to get my dinner and you had taken
all the breast of the chicken. I wasn&rsquo;t going to
eat your leavings,&rdquo; declared Miss Ella, color
coming back into her wan cheeks and the fire of
battle to her faded eyes. Helen laughed happily.
The sisters were quarreling again and
everything was assuming a more normal aspect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now both of you ladies must get to bed,&rdquo;
insisted the doctor, after Miss Louise had been
persuaded to eat some of Helen&rsquo;s good toast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you have had ball enough for tonight.&rdquo;
He looked at his watch. &ldquo;I will take you back
to Weston,&rdquo; he whispered to Helen.</p>

<p>Helen would not go until both of her old
friends were tucked peacefully in their great bed
and then, kissing them good-night, she stole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
quietly from the room. She was greatly relieved
that things had turned out so well and delighted
that she was to be taken back to the ball.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty nice to do your duty and still
have a good time,&rdquo; she said to herself.</p>

<p>Dr. Wright was waiting in the hall for her.
He silently bundled her up in her cape and hood
and together they stepped on the gallery.</p>

<p>The lazy moon was up now and outshining the
faithful stars. The great box bushes and thick
hedge cast deep shadows across the lawn. The
two stood for a moment in silence, drinking in
the beauty of the scene.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t lock the front door,&rdquo; said Dr.
Wright finally. &ldquo;I see it has an old-fashioned
great brass key and the only way to lock it is to
fasten the old ladies in the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, nothing will ever hurt those dear old
folks,&rdquo; laughed Helen. &ldquo;There are as safe as
can be. They tell me they often go to bed without
locking doors. They usually have a quarrel
about whether the front door has been locked or
not, and get so excited they both forget to do it.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="l1" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />

<span class="f8">A LITTLE LEARNING</span></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Listen! What is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A low rumble of voices was heard, coming
from the rear of Grantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could it be the dancers coming home?&rdquo; suggested
Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not from that direction!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The rumble increased to a roar, low but continuous.
Evidently a great many persons were
talking or muttering and they were getting
closer and closer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a light, so we kin see!&rdquo; said a
voice louder and clearer than the rest, and then
there was a guffaw from many throats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A lot of darkies!&rdquo; gasped Helen. &ldquo;What
can they be doing here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You go inside and I&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; commanded the
young man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do no such thing! I&rsquo;ll go with you and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
see. If I go in the house again I&rsquo;ll wake Miss
Ella and Miss Louise up, and you said yourself
that it was most important for them to have a
night of unbroken rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Helen, I insist!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not going to be sent back in the
house while you go get shot up or something, so
there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shot up! The idea! It is nothing but some
late revelers going home. Perhaps the darkies
have been having a ball somewhere, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, but they have no business coming
through Grantly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a hoarse shout from the rear and
suddenly a light shot up into the sky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The straw stack! They are burning the
straw stack!&rdquo; cried Helen.</p>

<p>George Wright quietly opened the great front
door and picking Helen up in his arms, carried
her into the hall. He put her down and hastily
closed the door. Helen heard the great brass
key turn in the lock.</p>

<p>It was very dark in the hall. She groped her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
way along the wall. It was all she could do to
keep from screaming, but remembering her two
old friends, now no doubt peacefully snoozing,
she held herself in check. Suddenly she bumped
square into the telephone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give a hurry call for the whole neighborhood,&rdquo;
she cried, and no sooner thought than
done. It was said afterwards that no such ringing
of a &rsquo;phone had ever been heard before in
the county.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<cite>Grantly on fire and a great crowd of negro
brutes in the yard!</cite>&rdquo; was the message that was
sent abroad.</p>

<p>The two old ladies slept peacefully on. Helen
could hear the deep stertorous snore, Miss
Louise&rsquo;s specialty, and the high steam-whistle
pipe that Miss Ella was given to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand this!&rdquo; cried the girl. &ldquo;They
may be killing him this minute; and he expects
me to stay shut up in this house while he gets
shot to death!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She felt her way back to the kitchen where she
could see well enough, thanks to the fire that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
desperadoes had kindled. She cautiously unlocked
the door and stepped out on the back
porch.</p>

<p>The negroes were dancing around the burning
stack, led by a tall gangling man whom Helen
recognized as Tempy&rsquo;s slue-footed admirer,
James Hanks. Some of them seemed to be
rather the worse for drink, and all of them were
wild-eyed and excited-looking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, gent&rsquo;men!&rdquo; cried the leader.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s git our loot while we&rsquo;s got light a-plenty.
The ol&rsquo; tabbies is safe at the count&rsquo;s ball, safe an&rsquo;
stuffin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a shout of laughter at this witticism.
Helen was trembling with fright, but not
fright for herself. The dear old ladies were uppermost
in her mind, and the doctor! Her doctor!
Where was he? Would he tackle all of
those crazy, half-drunk brutes single-handed
and not even armed?</p>

<p>A sudden thought came to her. She slipped
back into the kitchen. Remembering the box
tacked to the wall, just over the kerosene stove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
where the matches were kept, she felt along the
wall until her hand touched it. Then armed
with these matches she crept back through the
house to the great parlor where the trophies of
the dead and gone great-uncle, the traveler in
the Orient, were. She cautiously struck a
match, thankful that the parlor was on the other
side of the house from the fire, and seized at random
what old arms she could lay her hands on:
a great sword, that Richard the Lion-Hearted
might have wielded, an Arabian scimiter and a
light, curiously wrought shield. The sword was
heavy but she managed to stagger along the
hall with her load.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now remember, friends an&rsquo; citizens!&rdquo;
James Hanks was saying as he harangued the
crowd. &ldquo;This here prop&rsquo;ty by rights b&rsquo;longs to
us. Ain&rsquo;t we an&rsquo; our fo&rsquo;bars done worked this
here lan&rsquo; from time in memoriam? Ain&rsquo;t we
tilled the sile an&rsquo; hoed the craps fur these ol&rsquo;
tabbies an&rsquo; what is we got to show fur it?
Nothin&rsquo;! Nothin&rsquo;, I say! All we is a-doin&rsquo; on
this sacred night is takin&rsquo; what is ourn. &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
meet nor right fur two ol&rsquo; women to hab control
of all these fair lands, livin&rsquo; in luxry, wallowin&rsquo;
in honey an&rsquo; rollin&rsquo; in butter, while we colored
ladies an&rsquo; gent&rsquo;men is fo&rsquo;ced to habit pig stys an&rsquo;
thankful to git sorghum an&rsquo; drippin&rsquo;s. Don&rsquo;t
none of you go into this here undertakin&rsquo; &rsquo;thout
you is satisfied you is actin&rsquo; up to principles.
All what considers it they bounden duty to git
back what is by rights theirn, jes&rsquo; step forward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen counted fifteen men as they reeled forward.</p>

<p>Where was Dr. Wright? Was he hearing the
speech that the perfidious James was making?
And the old ladies&mdash;were they still sleeping?
The back porch was littered up with various
barrels and boxes, and behind these Helen
crouched. Of course she realized that the darkies
thought that Grantly was empty and that
they intended to break in and take what treasures
they could find. Would they be scared off
when they found someone was in the house, or
would they feel that they had gone too far to
retreat in their infamous undertaking? Whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
was to be the outcome, she must find the
doctor and help him, die by his side if necessary.</p>

<p>What an ending to the ball, the ball where she
had danced so gaily and happily! Had they
missed them yet? She had not been able to tell
what &rsquo;phones had answered her hurry call. She
had only known that several persons got on the
line and that her message had reached some ears,
but whose she could not say.</p>

<p>The mob had started towards the front.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ll go in the front way, now an&rsquo; ever
after,&rdquo; growled the leader. &ldquo;Only las&rsquo; week
that ol&rsquo; skinny Ella done driv me to the back do&rsquo;.
I come up the front way jes&rsquo; to tes&rsquo; her an&rsquo; she
sent me roun&rsquo; to the back jes&rsquo; lak some dog.
Whin we gits through, I reckon she&rsquo;ll be glad
enough if she&rsquo;s got a back do&rsquo; to go in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen waited to hear no more but streaked
around the opposite side of the house, bearing
her ancient weapons. Peeping through the railing
of the great gallery in front she espied
George Wright calmly standing in the doorway
which was flooded with moonlight.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX<br />

<span class="f8">IN THE MEANTIME</span></h2>


<p>Nan and Billy Sutton were the only persons
at Weston who knew that Helen and Dr.
Wright had left the house, and they, according
to instructions, had kept mum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hate for Helen to miss one teensy bit of the
ball,&rdquo; Nan said. &ldquo;She does so adore dancing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think she would. Anybody who
can dance like that ought to like it. I think she
is a ripper to go to those old grouches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Billy, that is no way to talk! Those
old ladies are really lovely. You would have
gone to them in a minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe! But I wouldn&rsquo;t have enjoyed
leaving this to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they will be able to come back.
Miss Louise is an awful alarmist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Supper was served, the waiters from Richmond
taking affairs into their own hands, so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
the untrained country servants at Weston were
pushed into the background.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Helen done said I&rsquo;s got quite a el&rsquo;gant
air in serving,&rdquo; grumbled Chloe, when she was
not allowed to bear in the trays of dainties to the
hungry guests. &ldquo;I reckon these here town niggers
thinks they is the king bees. I don&rsquo;t care
what they says, I&rsquo;s gonter git a sicond hep ter
my Miss Helen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl filled a tray with salad, croquettes,
sandwiches and what not and made her way into
the parlors. She peered around for her young
mistress. The rooms were well filled with the
country guests and many couples were having
their supper in the nooks made by the skilful decorators
of clumps of palms and evergreens.
Chloe peeped behind them all and not finding
her Miss Helen she went to Douglas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whar Miss Helen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t know, Chloe! What do you
want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want my Miss Helen ter git her fill er
victuals she ain&rsquo;t had ter mess in.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen her,&rdquo; laughed Douglas. &ldquo;Ask
Miss Nan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Nan, whar Miss Helen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Chloe, she has gone away but may be
back later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whar she gone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She told me not to tell, because she doesn&rsquo;t
want to disturb the others, but she has gone with
Dr. Wright to see Miss Ella Grant, who is ill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Ellanlouise is here to the ball, ain&rsquo;t
they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, they didn&rsquo;t come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Helen ain&rsquo;t gone ter Grantly, is she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then poor Chloe dropped her tray, laden with
goodies for her beloved mistress, and a mixture
of salad and croquettes and sandwiches rolled
over the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Gawd! My Gawd!&rdquo; shrieked the girl.
&ldquo;Whar the count? Whar Mr. Carter? Whar
that secondary?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; demanded the count sternly, as
he stepped over the débris.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;My Miss Helen done gone ter Grantly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that so? Why did she leave?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His calm tones quieted the girl a little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She done gone with Dr. Wright&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Ella Grant is ill and Helen went with
Dr. Wright to look after her,&rdquo; put in Nan. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know why Chloe is so excited.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time the guests were crowding around
the corner where Nan and Billy had ensconced
themselves for what they thought was to be a
quiet little supper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cited! I tell you, you&rsquo;d better git a move
on you, you count and you secondary. The niggers
is planning no good fur Grantly this night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What negroes?&rdquo; asked the count.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t no diffunce what niggers! You git
out that little red devil of a mobile an&rsquo; you licksplit
ter Grantly as fas&rsquo; as you kin, an&rsquo; you take
mo&rsquo;n one gun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If everybody had not been wrought up to a
high pitch of excitement, they would have been
amused to see this ignorant country black girl
handing out orders to the Count de Lestis as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
though she were a duchess and he a stable
boy.</p>

<p>The count motioned to Herz and they turned
and left the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I get in on this!&rdquo; cried Lewis Somerville.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I! And I!&rdquo; from every male throat in
the room.</p>

<p>Many of the farmers had pistols with them,
deeming it more prudent to go armed on midnight
drives through the lonely districts. Mrs.
Carter fainted when it was explained to her
where her daughter had gone and what the danger
was. For once in her life, however, her husband
had no thought for her. He left her to the
ministrations of the farmer&rsquo;s wife in the stiff
green silk, and hastened out to climb on the running-board
of the count&rsquo;s little car, which was
already under way.</p>

<p>In what seemed like a moment since the poor
Chloe had dropped her tray, there was not a single
white male left at Weston, except Bobby
Carter and he was only left because Lucy held
him, scratching and fighting to go to the rescue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
of his precious sister. Even the musicians from
Richmond had joined the posse. The negro
waiters stepped gingerly around with many superior
airs, congratulating themselves that they
were as they were and not as the ignorant country
blacks.</p>

<p>Chloe sat on the floor and rocked and moaned,
refusing to be comforted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I done what she tol&rsquo; me was right!&rdquo; was her
cryptic remark which none understood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do we wait here?&rdquo; asked Douglas, who
was pale as death.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter had been revived and was lying
on a sofa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, indeed! Let&rsquo;s get in the hay wagon
and go,&rdquo; said Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who can drive it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I!&rdquo; cried the redoubtable Mrs. Sutton.</p>

<p>Almost all of the carriages and buggies had
been requisitioned by the masculine element but
the hay wagon remained and a few other vehicles.
The horses were quickly unblanketed by
the women with the help of the waiters. Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
Carter and Douglas were the last to leave the
house, as the poor nervous lady was kept quiet
until they were ready to start.</p>

<p>Just as they were going out the door Douglas
heard a violent ringing of the telephone. Knowing
the peculiarities of a country connection and
its way of ringing at every house, and also knowing
that the long, violent, protracted ringing
meant emergency of some sort, Douglas ran to
answer it. She distinctly heard Helen&rsquo;s voice
crying the alarm:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<cite>Grantly on fire and a great crowd of negro
brutes in the yard!</cite>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, my dear?&rdquo; feebly asked Mrs.
Carter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all!&rdquo; said Douglas calmly. She
felt that such a message would only upset her
poor mother more, and it was best to keep it
locked within her own panting breast.</p>

<p>If any of the persons in that hay wagon should
live to be a thousand years old they could never
forget that terrible ride over the rough, muddy
roads on that twenty-second of February, 1917.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Look, the moon is up!&rdquo; whispered Lucy to
Mag, both of them remembering the gay ride to
the ball only a few hours before and how they
had remarked that it would be so jolly going
back because the moon would be up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s on fire!&rdquo; someone cried, and
then the heavens were lit by the burning straw
stack. A straw stack can make more light in
the sky than a Woolworth building if both
should be set afire; but the straw burns out so
quickly that it is little more than a flash in the
pan.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sutton proved a famous Jehu. She
managed her team quite as well as Billy. Nan
sat up on the high seat by her, looking with admiration
at the strong, capable hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think they will be in time?&rdquo; Nan
whispered to her valiant companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure they will, my dear! They are there
by this time and I believe that fire is nothing but
a straw stack. Look, even now how it is dying
down! Poor Miss Ella and Miss Louise! They
seem to have the faculty of not getting along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
with the darkies. They are as kind as can be to
them when they are sick or in want, but they always
have an overbearing manner with them
when they are well. I wonder what that girl
meant by saying she had done just as Helen had
told her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Helen has been so patient
with Chloe and has really made a pretty good
cook of her. She simply adores Helen. She
comes to her with all kinds of questions to answer
and problems of life to solve. Do you
think these colored men would want to kill
Helen just because they are angry with the
Misses Grant?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, my dear, I don&rsquo;t think these colored
men would want to kill anybody. God grant
they are not drunk! That is the only danger I
am fearing. I am not afraid of any sober negro
alive, but a drunken one is to be avoided like a
rattlesnake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Mrs. Sutton, I just feel somehow that
God and Dr. Wright are going to take care of
Helen,&mdash;and Miss Ella and Miss Louise, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure of it, my dear. I am so sure of it
that I am thanking God for having sent Dr.
Wright and Helen to Grantly,&mdash;otherwise the
poor, foolish old ladies might have been found
there by the darkies when they expected the
house to be empty, with everyone gone to the
ball, and then there is no telling what would have
happened.&rdquo; Mrs. Sutton shuddered as though
she were cold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I keep on thinking of Dr. Wright&rsquo;s face,&mdash;his
keen blue eyes and his jaw,&mdash;somehow, I believe
that jaw will pull them out safely.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="l1" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br />

<span class="f8">THE FLAMING SWORD</span></h2>


<p>And what a time we have had to keep Helen
peeping through the railings at Dr. Wright as
he stood in the brilliant moonlight on the gallery
at Grantly, while the crazed mob of darkies advanced
jauntily to the front of the old mansion!
It was their intention to enter and claim the
spoils thereof: treasures that they had begun to
think belonged to them by reason of their long
service and the service of their fathers and fathers&rsquo;
fathers.</p>

<p>Confident that the mansion was empty, they
made no endeavor to be quiet. All the white
folks for miles and miles around were feasting at
the count&rsquo;s ball; as for the burning rick,&mdash;they
had not thought that the fire would do more than
warm things up for their deed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now fur the loot!&rdquo; cried James Hanks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
&ldquo;An&rsquo; we mus&rsquo; hurry up, &rsquo;cause whin the ol&rsquo; tabbies
gits home from the ball they mus&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be hide
or har of the house lef&rsquo; standin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bus&rsquo; open the bar&rsquo;l er coal ile!&rdquo; suggested
one black brute, &ldquo;so&rsquo;s we can pour her on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They keep the coal ile in the woodshed,&rdquo; a
little bandy-legged man remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now see hyar! Befo&rsquo; we enter this here
domicyle, they&rsquo;s to be a reg&rsquo;lar understandin&rsquo;
&rsquo;bout the findin&rsquo;s,&rdquo; continued James Hanks.
&ldquo;The money is to be &rsquo;vided ekal an&rsquo; the silvo
and chino an&rsquo; other little value bowles is to be
portioned out &rsquo;cordin&rsquo; to they valubility.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sho&rsquo;! Sho&rsquo;! We&rsquo;s all &rsquo;greed to that!&rdquo; came
in a chorus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I goes fust, as the man &rsquo;pinted by Gawd as
yo&rsquo; leader.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As James Hanks started up the broad steps
he was dumfounded when Dr. Wright came forward.
He retreated down the steps and the
crowd of darkies behind him surged backward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it you want?&rdquo; asked the young
physician quite simply, in a voice as cool and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
natural as though he were a soda clerk dealing
out soft drinks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;er&mdash;we&mdash;we didn&rsquo;t know any of the
white folks was in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; and Dr. Wright came closer to
the nonplussed darky. &ldquo;Perhaps God has appointed
me to defend this home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We is hyar fur our rights,&rdquo; came from the
extreme edge of the crowd in a growling voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your rights!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yessah!&rdquo; and James Hanks spoke up more
bravely, emboldened by the support he felt the
crowd was able to give him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw go on, Jeemes! He ain&rsquo;t even armed,&rdquo;
cried the black brute who had been so free in his
suggestions about breaking open the barrel of
kerosene. &ldquo;Gawd wouldn&rsquo;t send nobody &rsquo;thout
even a razor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen saw the crowd pushing forward. She
felt a choking in her throat and loosened the cord
that fastened her evening wrap. The heavy
cape and hood fell to the ground. She was over
the railing in a twinkling of an eye, dragging her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
ancient weapons of offense and defense with her.
The hood had loosened her hairpins and now her
hair fell around her shoulders in a heavy shower.
She ran along the gallery, dragging the sword
with one hand and with the other clutching the
shield and scimiter. Without a word she thrust
the great sword in the outstretched hand of the
young man.</p>

<p>He looked at her in astonishment and terror.
Having locked her in the hall he had thought of
course she would remain there. At least, he had
so devoutly hoped so that he had made himself
believe that was where he would find her when
this wretched affair was over.</p>

<p>His face blanched and his knees trembled visibly.
The fear that he had not felt for himself
was intense for this girl, but he grasped the
sword and waved it over the crowd.</p>

<p>At sight of Helen the crowd set up a groan.
They sank on their knees or fell prone to the
earth. God had sent an angel of vengeance with
a flaming sword for their undoing. Indeed less
superstitious persons than those poor darkies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
might have been startled by the sudden appearance
of Helen Carter. Her dress, that Nan had
described as like the moon, might well have been
the garb of an angel. Her long light brown
hair, usually so carefully coiffed but now falling
below her waist, added to the make-up, as did
also the ancient shield and the crescent scimiter.</p>

<p>With the shield held forward, as though to
guard the doctor, and the scimiter raised aloft,
she stood gazing on the trembling crowd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gawd save this nigger! Gawd save this nigger!&rdquo;
cried the abject one with the bandy legs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A angel of destruction, carryin&rsquo; a flamin&rsquo;
sword! Lemme git out&rsquo;n this!&rdquo; wailed another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas Jeemes Hanks set fire to the straw
stack! Not me! Not me!&rdquo; from one who knelt
and rocked himself back and forth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t teched a thing what don&rsquo;t b&rsquo;long to
me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I jes&rsquo; come along to see the fun! I ain&rsquo;t
nebber had no idee er harmin&rsquo; Miss Ellanlouise!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me neither! Me neither!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Jeemes Hanks, He&rsquo;s the one, good Gawd!
He&rsquo;s the one!&rdquo;</p>

<p>James Hanks, goaded to desperation by the
backslidings of his followers, turned on them in
fury:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You low down sneaks! Can&rsquo;t you see that
this ain&rsquo;t no angel of the Lawd? This is one of
them gals come to live in the ol&rsquo; tumble-down
overseer&rsquo;s house, jes&rsquo; a play actin&rsquo; to scare you.
If&rsquo;n we can&rsquo;t down them we ain&rsquo;t worth of the
name of Loyal Af&rsquo;cans. Come on, boys, an&rsquo; let&rsquo;s
finish &rsquo;em an&rsquo; thin we can git our loot. I ain&rsquo;t
afraid of them. A flamin&rsquo; sword ain&rsquo;t in it with
a gun.&rdquo; He reached for his hip pocket.</p>

<p>Dr. Wright grabbed the angel of the Lord
most unceremoniously and held her behind him.
The kneeling and groveling mob was divided in
its feelings as to whether Helen was or was not
a celestial visitor, but they were one and all
anxious to be through with the night&rsquo;s work
without bloodshed. This was an outcome they
had not bargained for. To go to Grantly and
get all the money that they ignorantly supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
the old ladies to possess, to steal the silver and
whatever else they fancied and then to set fire to
the ancient pile, thereby destroying all trace of
their burglary, so that when the white folks came
home from the count&rsquo;s fine ball there would be
naught to tell the tale, was a very different matter
from this thing of having to get rid of two
persons, perhaps kill them and then be found
out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jeemes, you is foolish in de haid,&rdquo; spoke up
Bandy-Legs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed you are!&rdquo; came in clear ringing
tones from Helen as she waved her scimiter, the
moonlight flashing on it. &ldquo;This minute the
whole county knows that Grantly is on fire and
that all of you are here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, rats! Whatcher tryin&rsquo; ter give us?&rdquo;
from the scornful, incredulous leader.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am telling you what is so. As soon as I
heard you in the yard and saw the light from the
straw stack, I gave a hurry call and got the
neighbors on the &rsquo;phone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; what was you an&rsquo; the young man a-doin&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
of in Grantly?&rdquo; sneered James, coming up quite
close to Helen. &ldquo;Looks like whin Miss Ellanlouise
is to the ball, it&rsquo;s a strange place&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
but James was not allowed to finish what he had
to say. Dr. Wright&rsquo;s powerful fist shot out and
the darky received a scientifically dealt blow
square on his jaw bone that sent him backwards
down the steps, where he lay in a huddled heap
and like the Heathen Chinee:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Subsequent proceedings interested him no
more&rdquo;&mdash;at least, not for a while.</p>

<p>Their leader down and out, the crowd began
to melt away, but in a tone that commanded instant
obedience George Wright bade them to
halt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen, you fools! If one of you budges
from this spot until I give him permission I will
lick him to within an inch of his life. Miss Ella
Grant had a fainting spell and could not go to
the ball, and Miss Carter and I came over here
from Weston when her sister telephoned us the
trouble she was in. We were just leaving the
house when you arrived.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Miss Ellanlouise in dar now?&rdquo; asked a
trembling old man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Praise be ter Gawd fer stayin&rsquo; our han&rsquo;!
Praise be ter Gawd!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you had better give praise. I am not
going to tell you what I think of you for attempting
this terrible thing. You know yourselves
how wicked and foolish you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then a light shot across the yard and in a
moment the red car belonging to the count came
whizzing into view.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you may go, all but you, and you, and
you!&rdquo; indicating the ones who had been so glib
about the kerosene and their rights, and the one
who had known so well that God would not have
sent an angel without even a razor.</p>

<p>The men pointed out tremblingly obeyed,
coming up to the steps as though drawn by a
magnet. The rest of the mob simply disappeared,
dodging behind the box bushes and losing
themselves in the convenient labyrinth.</p>

<p>That little red car had brought over six men:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
the count and his secretary, Mr. Carter, Mr.
Sutton, Lewis Somerville and Bill Tinsley.
Hardly a word had been spoken on that ride.
The count had pushed the powerful engine to
its utmost ability and it had taken the car
through heavy mud, up hills and down dales,
through mire and ruts with a speed truly remarkable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some car!&rdquo; remarked Lewis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some!&rdquo; grunted Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter&rsquo;s mouth was close set and his eyes
looked like steel points. All of his girls were
dear to him but Helen had always seemed closer
for some reason; perhaps her very wilfulness
was the reason. And now as he thought of her
in danger, it seemed as though he could single-handed
tackle any number of foes. He prayed
continuously as he stood on the running-board of
that speeding car, but his prayer was perhaps
not very devout:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, God, let me get at them! Let me get at
them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The relief of finding his dear girl alive and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
unharmed was so great that Mr. Carter sobbed.
When Helen saw him jump from the car, she
flew down the box-bordered walk and threw herself
into his arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Daddy! Daddy! We saved Miss Ella and
Miss Louise!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who saved you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Wright saved me and I saved him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Sutton, who was magistrate for the district,
made short order in arresting James
Hanks and his companions. As the vehicles arrived
with the other members of the posse there
was some whisper of a lynching, but Mr. Sutton
downed the whisper with contempt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There hasn&rsquo;t been a lynching in Virginia for
eighteen years and I should hate our county to
be the one to break the record. It will have a
much more salutary effect to have these poor
fools locked up in jail and be brought to trial
with all of their deviltry exposed and aired in
the papers. After all, the only real harm done
is the burning of an old rotting straw stack that
was not fit for bedding, as I remember.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>The count and Herz were most solicitous in
their endeavors to help in any possible way. It
was decided that Grantly must be patrolled for
the rest of the night, as it was feared that some
of the darkies might return. Dr. Wright smiled
at the suggestion. He knew full well that the
poor negroes who had been allowed to depart
would not be seen or heard of for many a day.
He had seen too great and abject a fear in their
rolling eyes to have any apprehension of danger
from them.</p>

<p>James Hanks showed signs of returning life.
The young physician leaned over him and felt
his pulse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Umm hum! You had better be glad I
didn&rsquo;t break your jaw. You&rsquo;ll be all right in a
few days and in the meantime the quiet of the
lock-up will be very good for your nerves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, then that is some work that Herz and I
can do,&rdquo; cried the count. &ldquo;These men must be
taken to jail, and why should not we attend to
it? Eh, Adolph!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly!&rdquo; Herz had been looking very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
grim ever since Chloe had dropped the tray of
second helpings for Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish we had handcuffs,&rdquo; said Mr. Sutton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, that is hardly necessary. I should
think Herz and I with pistols could take four
poor devils, unarmed, to jail. Especially since
one of those devils has been already put out of
business by this skilful surgeon,&rdquo; laughed the
count.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I&rsquo;ll go along with you,&rdquo; sighed Mr.
Sutton who was accustomed to early retiring.
This midnight rioting was not much to his taste,
but he was determined as magistrate of the district
to see the matter safely through.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, my dear man, there is not a bit of use
in your going. You can trust Herz and me to
land them safely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, all right, but I feel responsible for the
good of the community and these black devils
must be locked up in the court-house jail before
many hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better take my car,&rdquo; suggested Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
Wright. &ldquo;It will hold the six of you more comfortably.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, not at all! Mine brought six of us over
here from Weston and can take six away. The
prisoners can stand on the running-boards, all
but the injured one, and he can sit by me. If
any of them attempts to escape we can wing him
quite easily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Wright felt rather relieved that his offer
was turned down. No man would relish his perfectly
new car being used to carry four bad darkies
to jail over roads that were quite as vile as
the prisoners.</p>

<p>Everyone felt grateful to the count for his unselfish
offer, everyone but Skeeter Halsey and
Frank Maury. They had fondly hoped to have
a hand in the undertaking. The night had been
a thrilling one for the two boys. They bitterly
regretted that they had not got there in time to
rush in and save Miss Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I felt like I could &rsquo;a&rsquo; killed at least six niggers,&rdquo;
Skeeter said to Lucy and Mag.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph! Only six? I could have put a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
dozen out of business,&rdquo; scoffed Frank; and Lucy
and Mag were sure they could.</p>

<p>The boys were allowed to divide the patrol duties
with Lewis and Bill, and very proud they
were as they stalked up and down in front of the
mansion and around the barnyard, keeping a
sharp lookout for skulking blacks.</p>

<p>Almost everything has an amusing side if one
can see it. Witness: the jokes that are cracked
by the men in the trenches in the midst of the
tremendous world tragedy. The amusing thing
about that night&rsquo;s happenings was that Miss
Ella and Miss Louise slept right through it.
Worn out by their cake making and wrangling,
intensely relieved that it was nothing but hunger
and not a stroke that had befallen one of them,
they had slept like two children.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII<br />

<span class="f8">A NEAT TRICK</span></h2>


<p>The court-house was due south of Grantly
and towards it the count turned his powerful little
car. After running about two miles, he made
a deviation to the west and then to the north.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much gasoline have we?&rdquo; he asked
Herz.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The tank is full.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good! I take it you grasp my intentions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course! I&rsquo;m no fool. It would never do
to have these idiots testify in court. Where to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Richmond! There we can turn them loose
with money enough to get north.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boss, ain&rsquo;t yer gonter han&rsquo; us over?&rdquo; asked
James Hanks, who was rapidly recovering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naturally not! You can thank your stars
that you are too big a fool to be trusted to face a
judge,&rdquo; snarled Herz.</p>

<p>The three negroes who were hanging to the
car were jubilant at the news.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I sho&rsquo; is lucky,&rdquo; said one. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t nebber
had no sinse an&rsquo; it looks lak it done he&rsquo;p me out a
heap ter be so foolish lak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be much easier to shoot them all
and testify that they endeavored to escape,&rdquo; suggested
Herz with a humorous twist to his ugly
mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, boss! Please don&rsquo;t do no sich a deed,&rdquo;
whined James Hanks. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t never a-goin&rsquo;
ter let on that you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you are not!&rdquo; and Herz put a cold
revolver against the negro&rsquo;s temple. &ldquo;You are
not even going to let on anything here in this
car. Now you keep your mouth shut, and shut
tight or I&rsquo;ll blow your head off. We&rsquo;ve got no
use for people who fail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heavens! What a Prussian you are,
Herz!&rdquo; laughed the count.</p>

<p>Richmond was reached in safety. Money was
handed out to each one of the grateful negroes
with instructions to take the first train north and
then to separate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll catch you sure if you stick together.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
But if they do catch you, you keep your black
mouths shut about anything connected with
the Count de Lestis or me,&mdash;do you understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They understood and made off as quickly as
they could.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t he a tur&rsquo;ble slave driver, though?&rdquo;
said the bandy-legged one, and the others agreed.</p>

<p>No time for rest for the occupants of the little
red car. Back they went over the muddy roads
as fast as the wonderful engine could take them.
It was just dawn when they reached a certain
spot in the road on the way to the court-house
where they considered it most likely they could
work their machinations.</p>

<p>There was a sharp curve with a steep embankment
on the outer edge. The car was carefully
steered until two wheels were almost over the
precipice. Then the count alighted, first turning
off his engine. With shoulders to the wheel, the
two men pushed until the machine toppled over
into the ditch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, my darling! I hated to do it. I hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
you are not much hurt,&rdquo; said the count whimsically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now roll on after her,&rdquo; and Herz pushed
his employer over the embankment. Then he
jumped down himself and wallowed in the mud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s blood a-plenty for both of us. You
can furnish blue blood but I have good red blood
for two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He deliberately gashed his arm with his penknife
and smeared his face with blood, and then
rubbed it all over the countenance of the laughing
count, who seemed to look upon the whole
affair as a kind of college boy&rsquo;s prank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now your ankle is sprained and you can&rsquo;t
walk, so I&rsquo;ll go to the nearest farmhouse for assistance
and there telephone Mr. Sutton that his
prisoners have escaped. You were pinioned under
the car and I had to dig you out,&mdash;remember!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, but I wish you would have the
sprained ankle and let me go for aid. I&rsquo;m
beastly hungry and besides I don&rsquo;t want to be
laid up just now. I rather wanted to take a walk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
with Miss Douglas Carter this afternoon.
Heavens! Wasn&rsquo;t she beautiful last night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much more beautiful than her sister, although
I tell you that that Helen was very wonderful,
especially after her hair came down and
she had played angel. I wish I could have taken
that stupid doctor&rsquo;s car instead of my own little
red devil. I should have enjoyed ditching his
car, but we needed the endurance and speed of
my own darling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better be having some pain now in
case a traveler comes along the road. I&rsquo;ll get
help as soon as possible;&rdquo; and Herz went off
without any comment on the comparative beauty
of the two Misses Carter. Douglas was to him
the most beautiful person in all the world, but he
hated himself for loving her, feeling instinctively
that his love was hopeless. His very name was
against him and should she ever know the truth&mdash;but
pshaw! These stupid people never would
find out things. They were as easy to hoodwink
as the darkies themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Sutton&rsquo;s fury knew no bounds when he
got the message from Herz that the prisoners
had escaped. It was with difficulty that he composed
himself sufficiently to ask after the welfare
of the two gentlemen who had undertaken the
job of landing the negroes safely in jail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Count de Lestis has sprained his ankle
and his face is all smeared with blood,&mdash;I could
not tell how great were his injuries,&rdquo; lied the
unblushing one over the telephone. &ldquo;I spent
hours getting him from under the car. Fortunately
the mud was soft and deep and he is
not seriously injured.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just where was the accident?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At that sharp curve in the road about two
miles this side of the court-house,&mdash;just beyond
the bridge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Umhum! Do you need any assistance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I thank you. I&rsquo;ll get some mules to
right the car. I think I am mechanic enough to
repair the engine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How about a doctor for your friend? Dr.
Wright is still with the Carters.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;er&mdash;ah&mdash;I think he can get along very
well without calling in a physician. I have
bandaged his ankle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did a good deal before you gave warning
as to the escape of the prisoners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no answer to this remark, so without
further ceremony Mr. Sutton hung up the
receiver.</p>

<p>There was to be no rest for the weary, it
seemed. A search party must be called and the
country scoured for the missing men.</p>

<hr class="l1" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XXIII<br />

<span class="f8">VISITORS AT PRESTON</span></h2>


<p>Dr. Wright was pretty sure that James
Hanks would not have been able to travel very
far after the knockout blow he had received, so
when they could not find him in the woods near
by it was decided he must be in hiding in some
cabin. The search continued but no trace was
found of the missing men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sounds shady to me,&rdquo; declared Lewis Somerville.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The idea! You can&rsquo;t mean that the count
and Mr. Herz deliberately let the men get
away!&rdquo; exclaimed Douglas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe they are capable of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lewis! How can you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you I mistrust them both. I don&rsquo;t like
their names&mdash;I don&rsquo;t like their looks&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
like their actions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor do I,&rdquo; declared Billy Sutton, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
dropped in that morning to have a chat after the
ball. Everybody was too exhausted to think of
going on with any very arduous work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I think that after you accepted the
count&rsquo;s hospitality you have no right to say
things about him,&rdquo; broke in Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, hasn&rsquo;t he accepted the hospitality of
this country, and what is he doing? Don&rsquo;t you
know it is that fool darky school that got all
those poor nigs thinking that Grantly belonged
to them? I bet Miss Helen agrees with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Helen faintly. &ldquo;I
am all mixed up about the whole thing. Why
should the count want to make trouble?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The matter was discussed up and down by the
young people. The males for the most part
sided against the count and his secretary, the females,
with the exception of Lucy and Mag, taking
up for them. Mrs. Carter was most indignant
that anyone should say anything disagreeable
about a gentleman of such fine presence and
engaging manners as the Count de Lestis, one
who knew so well how to entertain and who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
so lavish. As for the other man, that Herz, no
doubt he was fully capable of any mischief. He
could not dance, had no small talk, and held his
fork in a very awkward way when at the table.</p>

<p>The count&rsquo;s ankle did not keep him in very
long. He was soon around, although he limped
quite painfully. His only difficulty was in remembering
which foot was injured. He renewed
his attentions towards the ladies at Valhalla.
His protestations of concern for the
Misses Grant were warm and convincing. He
offered to come stay with them or let Herz come
until they were sure that the county had settled
down into its usual state of safety and peace.</p>

<p>Those ladies were not in the least afraid, however,
but still declared that nobody would ever
hurt them. It turned out that on the night of
what came so near being such a tragedy they had
had in the house exactly three dollars and twenty
cents. What an angry crowd it would have been
when they began the division!</p>

<p>Now came stirring news in the daily papers.</p>

<p>Diplomatic relations were broken with Germany<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
and the declaration of war imminent!
Excitement and unrest were on every hand.
Sometimes Nan and Lucy would come home
laden with extras with headlines of terror and
bloodshed. Mr. Carter occasionally went to
town with them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel as though I must find out what people
are saying and thinking,&rdquo; he would declare.</p>

<p>The truth of the matter was that Mr. Carter
was well,&mdash;as well as ever, and the mere chopping
of wood and stopping of cracks was not
enough to occupy him. It had seemed to him as
he went on that mad ride to the rescue of his beloved
Helen that he was absolutely himself
again. No longer could he let people plan his
life for him. He was a man and meant to take
the reins into his own hands. Not that his girls
had not driven the family coach excellently well.
They were wonderful, but he was able to do it
for himself now and he intended to start.</p>

<p>He consulted Dr. Wright:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you, Wright, I am as fit as a fiddle and
can get to work now.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you are! Didn&rsquo;t I give you a
year? You have not taken quite a year but the
time is almost up. The shock that night of the
ball helped you on to a complete recovery a little
ahead of time. Sometimes a nervous patient
gets a shock that does more than rest. The
trouble is, one can&rsquo;t tell whether it will kill or
cure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, this one cured all right. Why, man, I
could build a cathedral tomorrow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never can thank you enough for your kindness
to me and my family. If there is ever anything
I can do for you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt there will be,&rdquo; was the doctor&rsquo;s
cryptic remark.</p>

<p>Herz kept up his walks with Douglas, although
the girl did nothing to encourage him.
She did everything to discourage him, in fact, except
actually ask him to let her alone. She
would find him waiting on the road after school.
Sometimes he would even come to the school
door for her if for any reason she was detained.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
These walks were usually taken when the count
was off on one of his many business trips.</p>

<p>In Virginia, March means spring, although
sometimes a very blustering spring. If one wanders
in the woods it is quite usual to find hepatica
and arbutus making their way up through the
leaves. The tender green begins to make its appearance
on hedge and tree, and in the old gardens
jonquils and daffodils and crocuses pop up
their saucy heads, defying possible late snows
and frosts.</p>

<p>The roads were still muddy but not quite so
bad as in the winter, and now, more than ever,
Douglas with her faithful protector, Bobby,
could enjoy the walks to and from school. The
stilts did not have to be used nearly so often, although
Nan and Lucy had become such adepts
on their flamingo legs that they often mounted
them merely for the pleasure and not because of
the mud.</p>

<p>Valhalla was growing lovelier day by day.
The gaunt trees had taken on a veil of green.
The nations were at war. The United States was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
being forced into the game in spite of her attempts
at neutrality; but Mother Nature&rsquo;s slogan
was: &ldquo;Business as usual!&rdquo; and she was attending
to it exactly as she had from the beginning
and as she will until the end of time.</p>

<p>Spring had come in good earnest, and with her
the myriads of little creatures who must work so
hard for a mere existence. Strange scratchings
had begun in the chimneys at Valhalla. The
swallows were back and gave the Carters to understand
that they had been tenants in that old
overseer&rsquo;s house long before those city folks ever
thought of such a thing as spending the winter
in such a place. The robins were hopping about
the lawn, trying to decide where they would
build, while the mocking-birds were already busy
in the honeysuckle hedge.</p>

<p>One Saturday, the Saturday before war was
actually declared, the Count de Lestis came to
call, bringing with him in a lovely wicker cage a
carrier pigeon for Douglas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You promised that sometimes you would
send me a message, remember,&rdquo; he said with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
sentimental glance that Douglas refused to respond
to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly I will. I&rsquo;ll send a note asking you
to come to dinner. Would that do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything you send will do,&rdquo; he sighed.</p>

<p>The pigeon was a beautiful little creature with
glossy plumage and dainty red legs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will come back straight to Weston because
he has young in the nest. He is not like
some men who are up and away at the smallest
excuse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how cruel to take him away from his
young!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, but the hausfrau is there! She will see
that no harm befalls the babies. And, too, she
will remain faithful until her lord returns. As
faithful as a pigeon means true unto death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pigeon house had continued to be a thorn
in the flesh to Mr. Carter. It was painted white,
as that is what the pigeons like, and it was so
large and so out of tone with the fine lines of the
roof that Mr. Carter declared he could not bear
to go to Weston any more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>No trace of the lost negroes was found, although
Mr. Sutton had detectives from Richmond
to work on the case. They had evidently
got away and well away. The farmer who had
been so nearly asleep when Helen and Dr.
Wright arrived at the ball, the farmer whose
wife wore the stiff, green silk, declared he had
passed that road on the way home that night and
he had seen no sign of a red car turned turtle
down a ditch. Of course the neighbors all said
he had been driving in his sleep.</p>

<p>Mr. Sutton made a trip into Richmond and
had a conference with the governor. He told
him that the bloodhounds employed to trace the
darkies had never left the scene of the accident,
although they had had many things belonging to
the escaped men as a clue to tracing them. The
governor told Mr. Sutton something that made
him open his honest eyes very wide. At the same
time he was cautioned to keep his honest mouth
shut very tight. He came back to Preston with
an air of mystery about him that disconcerted his
good wife greatly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Margaret, could you accommodate a guest
just now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, certainly, if it is necessary, but who is
the guest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A gentleman I have never met, maybe there
will be two of them,&mdash;but we must pretend they
are our very good friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, William, are you crazy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am!&rdquo; and then he whispered something
to her, although they were alone, and she,
too, opened her eyes very wide but promised to
keep her mouth shut.</p>

<p>The visitors came, two quiet gentlemen with
good manners and simple habits. Mr. and Mrs.
Sutton decided they should be some long lost
cousins from the west who were in the country
for their health. Thus they explained their
visitors to Billy and Mag and their neighbors.
They brought a small Ford runabout which they
used a great deal.</p>

<p>Mr. Sutton had a long conference with Mr.
Carter. There was some more opening of eyes
and shutting of mouths.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What a fool I have been!&rdquo; cried that gentleman.
&ldquo;I can see it all now. Lewis Somerville
tried to make me see but I was quite hard on the
boy. Well! Well! What is to be done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing! Just bide our time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See here, Sutton, I believe there was method
in that man&rsquo;s madness when he got two electric
light systems. He told me to order one and then
said his secretary had ordered one, too. Pretended
he had not told me to, and then was tremendously
kind and magnanimous about it. I
began to think maybe I had not understood,&mdash;you
see my head hadn&rsquo;t been very clear for business
for many months and I mistrusted myself.
I&rsquo;ll wager anything that that extra battery is
running a wireless station at Weston.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Geewhilikins!&rdquo; exclaimed the elder Sutton
in very much the same tone his son might have
used. &ldquo;This business is growing very exciting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sometimes the two quiet gentlemen visitors at
Preston would go out for an airing in their little
car, and finding a secluded spot in a pine woods,
one of them would cleverly convert himself into
an Armenian pedlar with a pack filled with
cheap lace and jewelry. Then he would make
the rounds of the cabins. He could speak almost
no English when doing this part and
seemed not to understand any at all. He
visited every house in Paradise and from there
made his way to Weston. His heavy, blue-black
beard and long straggling hair so completely
disguised him that the count never dreamed the
man he saw at his kitchen door haggling with his
colored cook over some coarse pillow shams was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
the same smooth-faced gentleman he had met
that morning driving with his neighbor Sutton.</p>

<p>As a book agent, the clever detective gained
access to the count&rsquo;s library and actually sold
him a set of Ruskin. As telephone inspector, he
got much information desired, and as a government
agricultural expert, he was favored with a
long, intimate talk with the owner of Weston.</p>

<p>Old Blitz, the German farmer near Preston,
came in for his share of visits, too, from pedlars
and book agents, etc. The mills of the government
were grinding slowly but they were grinding
exceeding small.</p>

<p>The neighborhood was in absolute ignorance
of the fact that their delightful count was being
watched. His comings and goings were known.
He had few secrets. It was learned by the detectives
that he was not a Hungarian at all but
his father was Austrian, his mother Prussian.
He had been sent to this country by his government
to make trouble among the negroes and to
buy up tracts of land for future emigration.
When the world was to be Prussianized, fair
Virginia was not to be neglected.</p>

<p>The raid on Grantly was traced absolutely to
his lectures and the teachings of Herz, the so-called
secretary. The only thing that had gone
wrong was that the negroes had acted sooner
than their masters had planned. Their object
had been to have a general uprising and they
wanted it to be timed about when war was declared.
Their schemes had not been directed
against poor old Grantly especially, but against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
all the whites, with a view of keeping the darkies
out of the army.</p>

<p>Herz turned out to be a full-blooded Prussian,
who had lived in Cincinnati for about five
years. He was a trusted spy of his government
and had done wonderful work for them in
Mexico. He was really the brains of the partnership
and de Lestis the mixer. When de Lestis
went off on his long business trips to Chicago
and New York it developed he had been across
the water several times, bearing with him maps
and information that must be personally conducted.</p>

<p>A wireless station was suspected but it was
difficult to locate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look in the pigeon house,&rdquo; suggested Mr.
Carter, still bearing a grudge against the atrocity
that had ruined his beloved roof line.</p>

<p>There it was, as neatly installed an instrument
as one could find with the extra batteries doing
the work perfectly. The telephone inspector
found it quite easily. The pigeon house was a
hollow sham. There was a reason for making it
so large since the wireless was to have an inner
chamber.</p>

<p>The net was drawing more closely around the
two men but they, scornful of the intelligence of
the stupid Americans, went unconcernedly on,
laying their plans and hatching their deviltries.
Many a laugh they had over the automobile accident.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those darkies before a clever lawyer would
have been our undoing,&rdquo; they admitted to one
another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>The night school was discontinued for the time
being and the poor colored people got back into
their one time rut. Tempy resumed her labors
at Grantly, a sadder and wiser girl. She no
longer slept amidst the unwashed dishes but
seemed anxious to become as good a servant as
her sister Chloe. Sam, the factotum, returned in
time to put in the garden.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV<br />

<span class="f8">THE CARRIER PIGEON</span></h2>


<p>There came a day in mid-April that will always
be remembered by the dwellers in Valhalla.
Herz had walked home from school with Douglas,
and contrary to his custom, had come in when
they reached the house. He was in a strange,
fierce humor and it seemed to Douglas as though
his near-sighted eyes were boring holes in her.
She could not keep her mind and talk off the
war and whenever war was mentioned he became
very glum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now that we are at war, will you not enlist?&rdquo;
she asked. &ldquo;If you are a true American,
I do not see how you can help it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My eyes would debar me. Near-sighted
men can&rsquo;t always serve where they would like
to,&rdquo; he answered rather bitterly. &ldquo;You see
good in no one but a soldier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, not at all!&rdquo; blushed Douglas. &ldquo;Of
course, when my country is at war I want our
young men to be willing to fight. Being a girl
is all that keeps me here. You might work in a
munition factory and help that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, I should like that! Would you think
more of me if I could help your country in some
way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your country, too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herz had come so close to her as they stood
in the middle of the quaint old living-room that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
Douglas felt a desire to run away. She welcomed
the sight of Helen running across the
lawn from the direction of Grantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess!&rdquo; panted Helen, bursting in on them.
&ldquo;I have seen James Hanks! He was sneaking
out of the kitchen at Grantly. Had been in to
see Tempy, I reckon. The man is crazy about
her. Miss Louise saw him, too, and has &rsquo;phoned
Mr. Sutton. I fancy he is on the way over here
now with those western cousins of his. Funny
men, aren&rsquo;t they? Miss Ella says she never
heard of either Mr. or Mrs. Sutton&rsquo;s having any
western kin, and she has known them and all
their people for pretty near a century. I believe
they are detectives myself, trying to find those
runaway darkies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While Helen was giving out this information,
Herz stood as though he had turned to stone.
His face was white with a red spot on each high
cheek bone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is your carrier pigeon?&rdquo; he asked
Douglas abruptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cage hangs on the porch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He drew from his pocket a small note-book
and wrote rapidly in it. Tearing out the sheet,
he strode to the porch, and with a small rubber
band he quickly attached the note to the foot of
the docile bird that he had grabbed from the cage
without even a &ldquo;by your leave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; demanded Douglas.
Was the man crazy?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; cried Helen. &ldquo;Count de Lestis
gave that bird to my sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and she was to send him a message.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
This is the message. It is as he would have it,
I am sure. You remember he told you he would
rather someone would seek him than search him.
He shall have his choice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He carried the pigeon out on the lawn and
freed it. The clever bird rose in a spiral flight
and then started straight towards Weston and
its mate. Without a word, Herz left the girls
and started towards Weston, too, taking a line
almost as straight as the one the pigeon had
chosen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he crazy, Douglas?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think he is something worse. I believe he
is afraid of detectives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The count and his confederate got away,&mdash;although
they were captured later on in North
Carolina. The faithful red car carried them off
rapidly. De Lestis was waiting for his one time
secretary at the cross roads by Paradise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you destroy the papers and maps?&rdquo;
gasped that gentleman as he sprang into the
car.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How could I when your call was so urgent?
I brought all the money, though. Those fools
will never find the wireless. They have no imagination.
And I have the grey paint to put my
darling here in her uniform.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That night, after having speeded for hours,
the two men drew the little red car into the
woods where they painted her a dingy grey.
The count had purchased the paint only the day
before at the country store.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In case of an emergency!&rdquo; he had told
Herz.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>Little did he dream that one of the visitors at
Mr. Sutton&rsquo;s found out before night that he had
bought the paint, and that when messages were
sent in every direction to look out for two
German spies, information was also given that
they would be in a red car that had more than
likely been painted grey.</p>

<p>When Weston was thoroughly searched,
many things besides the wireless station were
brought to light. One of the detectives brought
to Douglas a letter addressed in Lewis Somerville&rsquo;s
writing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you find it?&rdquo; blushed Douglas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the count&rsquo;s desk! I am sorry to have to
tell you that it was my duty to read it before
giving it to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the letter Lewis had written from the
Mexican border and no wonder Douglas
blushed. He had made most violent love to her
in this letter and had also spoken quite openly
of the situation in Mexico from a soldier&rsquo;s standpoint.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing is too small for them!&rdquo; cried Douglas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what an escape we have made!&rdquo; exclaimed
Helen. &ldquo;I bet you that man has made
love to every one of us except Lucy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He had better not say anything sweet to
me,&rdquo; said that young lady. &ldquo;Mag and I never
could abide him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I liked him a whole lot,&rdquo; sighed Nan.
&ldquo;He appreciated poetry so thoroughly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were three young men who were secretly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
glad when the count and Herz were
caught: Dr. Wright, Lewis Somerville and Billy
Sutton. They did not wish to be ungenerous,
but it <em>was</em> hard to have your especial girl monopolized
on every occasion.</p>

<p>The Misses Grant never could be made to understand
that their precious count was a spy.
&ldquo;He was a charming gentleman and we want to
hear nothing unkind about him,&rdquo; they actually
agreed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter insisted it was all the doings of
that common Herz, who did not know how to
conduct himself in a ballroom and who held his
fork so awkwardly at the table. And Mr. Carter,
true to his professional instinct, declared he
had had his doubts about de Lestis from the moment
he sacrificed his roof line to the pigeon
house.</p>

<p>But whatever the opinion held by the various
members of the Carter family, all agreed that the
surprising summer at Valhalla was one long to
be remembered. Fascinating as had been its
mysteries, its uncertainties, its new friendships
and responsibilities however, not one of the
family was sorry to return to Richmond. There,
as fall advanced into winter, new doors of opportunity
were opened and old associations renewed.
Once more there were numbered among
the city&rsquo;s happily busy people &ldquo;The Carter Girls
of Carter House.&rdquo;</p>
